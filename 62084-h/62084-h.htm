<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>I found Martelli to be more useful to
me than I could have expected. He had
called himself practical, and he was practical.
He was used to the punctilious regularity
of schools, to the difficult inattention of
pupils; and the habits these experiences
had engendered well qualified him in one
sense for the post I had offered. In one
sense I say: by which I mean my need of
an influence to direct my studies and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
me to them. But in him I missed what I
had sought, and would have taken in preference,
could I have found. Sympathies he
had in abundance, but they were commonplace.
He shone indeed; but rather with
the borrowed light of letters than the
luminous atmosphere of imagination. He
could not comprehend me, though he would
never appear puzzled. He would miss a
delicate implication. In taste he was a
sensualist, esteeming the full-blooded, florid,
and passionate conceptions of art above her
chaste aerial hints and tender moonlit
beauties. Yet he was a good and sound
scholar. His knowledge of Greek and
Latin was singularly exact. He was deeply
read in modern literature; and his surprising
memory enabled him to display to
the utmost advantage the various and carefully
stored treasures of his mind. But
though his erudition might have enabled
him to have edited with accuracy the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
obscure work in the whole range of ancient
literature, his imagination would not have
yielded him five lines of poetry.</p>

<p>When together in the library, he would
often extort a smile from me by the
recollection he excited of my school days.
Brisk in his movements, energetic in his
actions, pungent and austere in his resolute
directions, he recalled to me a French tutor,
whom, of all my early tutors, I most hated
for his severity. But the task conned, the
subject discussed, the book closed, his
manner would change; he would be ceremoniously
courteous, with almost a hint of
obsequiousness in his behaviour, as though
he wished me to understand that his sturdy
discharge of his duty did not prevent him
from appreciating the difference of position
between us.</p>

<p>I should have benefited more from his
counsels had my thoughts been less <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>preoccupied
with the subject which was hardly
ever absent from my mind.</p>

<p>But I found it impossible wholly to
surrender my attention to my tasks.
Memory persistently reverted to the strange
and beautiful apparition that had startled
me in my midnight saunter. Every day,
nay, every hour, was increasing my desire
to know her. Yet I could hit upon no
means of introduction. To have hung
about her house, to have loitered near her
garden, even had the absence of my companion
rendered such a device practicable,
would have been unwise; since, if now
from no apparent cause she shunned intrusion
or inspection, greater would be her
efforts to maintain her privacy when she
discovered a stranger sought to violate it.</p>

<p>One thing I could not hide from myself&mdash;I
was in love with her. I am well aware
that under the circumstances the feeling was
most absurd; but I could not help it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
memory of her beauty took shape before
me at all hours, in all moods. And my
love was illustrated and confirmed by my
wish to meet, to know, to speak with
her.</p>

<p>Martelli noticed my abstraction. More
than once I had remarked his dusky eyes
glowing on me with a gaze of interrogative
inspection. But he carefully repressed his
curiosity. No observation ever escaped
him to hint his perception of inattentive
moods.</p>

<p>Once, meeting his eyes, it occurred
to me to take him into my confidence.</p>

<p>"The Italians," I mused, "are famous for
their handling of love matters. They at
least bear the reputation of being subtle and
secret in such adventures. They wind into the
most tortuous intrigues like a snake through
the intricacies of a forest. Why not tell
him my story? A young man in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a woman whom he has seen but once, is an
object neither remarkable nor unique. He
might aid me by procuring an introduction,
at all events; and if he can do this, he has
my full consent to think what he likes of the
business."</p>

<p>It was evening. We were seated at a
table in the library, near the window, which
was wide open to admit the still and sultry
air. There was no moon; but the stars,
large, full and liquid, lent a pale radiance to
the gloom. I rose, took a cigar from the
mantel-piece and lighted it.</p>

<p>"Let us close these books for to-night,"
I said. "The air is oppressive; and
those sweet stars seem to chide us for preferring
the inspiration of other things to
theirs."</p>

<p>He smiled, drew a meerschaum from his
pocket, and began to smoke. I pushed the
table aside that I might seat myself more
fully in the window.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is a line in one of Keats's poems&mdash;'Hyperion,'"
I said.</p>

<p>"I know it," he interrupted. "A noble
poem."</p>

<p>"Noble, indeed. There is a line in that
poem which I do not think I ever
thoroughly understood until now. I refer
to the line in which he speaks
of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;'tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Look at those round, moony orbs, tremulous
like tears wept by the gods; the trees yonder
seem spell-bound beneath them."</p>

<p>"Truly," he answered.</p>

<p>"Surely theirs is a magical repose: a
deeper calm than that of sleep. Oh, I can
forgive much to the superstition of astrology.
Those planets deserve to be influences if
they are not. The malignant heart would
of course make their shine sinister; but a
generous nature must deem those clear rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
benignant. I do. But it is the common
effect of Beauty on me. I warm, I dilate
in her presence. She is a glorious
spirit."</p>

<p>"Ay, to a man of taste."</p>

<p>"Beauty of course is a spirit interpenetrating
all that delights and elevates.
But she is incarnate too, sometimes; falling,
I suppose, from the heavens like that meteor
there," I said, pointing to an exhalation
that rushed with yellow tresses streaming
through the dark; "and taking the
shape of a woman when she touches the
earth."</p>

<p>"But is not innocence a condition of
beauty?" he inquired, turning his dusky
gaze upon me.</p>

<p>"It should be."</p>

<p>"Then do not make your spirit take the
shape of woman."</p>

<p>I laughed. "What shape would you
have her?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I hardly
know," he answered: "unless you make
her a new-born babe."</p>

<p>"I fear you have the scholar's contempt
for the <i>tendre passion</i>," said I. "But
listen now to a strange story. Do you see
those trees yonder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>"One night&mdash;it was clear with moonlight&mdash;I
strolled out to breathe the air. My
excursion extended to those fields you can
see from your bedroom window. There I
lingered. The village clock struck two.
Hardly had the silvery notes died,
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused.</p>

<p>"You returned home, Sir?"</p>

<p>"No. But looking, I perceived the
Spirit of Beauty walking beneath the starlight,
draped in white, with eyes deep and
beautiful, in which the moon hid itself for
love, with a face of marble, passionless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the feature of the mother of Paphus ere
the sculptor's adoration made her rosy with
life."</p>

<p>He showed his gleaming teeth in a smile
of which he thought the gloom would
hide the contempt.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "you are talking the
language of the romancist."</p>

<p>"I am talking the language of truth."</p>

<p>"At two o'clock in the morning," he exclaimed,
blowing a white cloud on the air,
"the female shapes one meets abroad are seldom
spiritual. How they may look in the
country, and by starlight, I do not know;
but by gaslight their cadaverous complexion
is commonly cloaked with paint; and if their
eyes are bright, it is rather with a spirituous
than a spiritual ray."</p>

<p>"Ah, Martelli, you are a cynic&mdash;by which
I mean, a practical, astute man, who makes
the root and not the flower of fact or fancy
his business. A commendable quality! All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the same, I would not part with my love of
illusion. This essential difference of character
will make us get on well together;
though, to be plain, before I knew you, my
opinion was that if I hoped to please or be
pleased, my comrade must be a man of sympathies
identical with my own."</p>

<p>"A common and generous error," he replied;
"but time corrects those crudities."</p>

<p>"As a proof, I like you none the worse
for the misanthropic pleasure you take in
extinguishing the candle in the magic-lantern
of fancy&mdash;at the moment when the panoramic
reflections most delight me. But respecting
this apparition&mdash;here is no illusion; for I
have found out who she is."</p>

<p>He smoked in silence.</p>

<p>"Her name is Mrs. Fraser. She is a widow.
She lives in that house yonder, where the
light shines through the trees. I have only
seen her once, and the circumstances of that
meeting may have served to exaggerate my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
impression of her. But the recollection I
carried away with me is that of a woman of
a beauty whose mysteriousness defies description."</p>

<p>"If you desire to be disenchanted, Mr.
Thorburn, you should get to know her."</p>

<p>"I should be happy to risk my idealism;
but how am I to procure an introduction?
Her house is a cloister&mdash;she a nun, secret
and exclusive as the austerest of the flannelled
sisterhood."</p>

<p>"Were we in Italy, I should advise you
to serenade her. There love is studied as
a fine art. It is different here. Yet were I
in your straits&mdash;for, Mr. Thorburn, are
you not in love with this beautiful phantom
of yours?"</p>

<p>"I confess it."</p>

<p>"If I were in your straits, I say, I should
do something hardy; go to her home,
procure admittance at any sacrifice of politeness,
and leave the rest to chance."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>"That would be practicable to a man
with a temperate pulse and trained nerves," I
replied; "but I believe I could much more
easily jump off the cliff than place myself in
the position you suggest."</p>

<p>"But you say you met her, Sir. Did she
not see you?"</p>

<p>"No. She stood some yards from me
tranquil and statuesque, quite unconscious
of my presence&mdash;<i>that</i> I could swear."</p>

<p>"Surely she must have seen you&mdash;the
moon, you said, was bright."</p>

<p>"She did <i>not</i> see me. It is true I uttered
an exclamation of surprise when I found
her so close to me; for I thought she had
vanished. She may have heard that
cry."</p>

<p>"But what should this lady be doing in
the fields at two o'clock in the morning?"
he asked, with a light smile.</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I wish to
know."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>He slowly filled another pipe, with his
lips moving as though in the process of
rehearsal.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorburn," said he, "I am sure
you will excuse my freedom. I really think
you should banish this subject from your
mind. You have settled here for the purpose
of prosecuting a good and lofty purpose,
and you should suffer nothing to seduce you
from devoting your whole energies to its
accomplishment. No man can serve two
mistresses. And knowledge, Sir, let me
assure you, is a mistress who, if she does
not receive your whole heart, will give you
little in return."</p>

<p>"Your candour requires no apology,
Martelli," I answered. "I am sure you
speak for my good, and I am grateful for
the interest you take in me. But I must
tell you that this woman has occupied my
thoughts so long, that it is become a positive
necessity to know her. Don't smile at what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
I am about to say&mdash;I protest, for my part,
I was never more in earnest&mdash;I believe," I
said solemnly, "that this woman is to be an
influence on my life&mdash;though whether baneful
or benignant is still the secret of the
future. Why do you shrug your shoulders?
Don't you believe in presentiments&mdash;in the
power of the soul to foreshadow destiny?
A few hours before I met her&mdash;this lady&mdash;she
presented herself to me in a dream.
Your sceptical mind would pronounce this
a coincidence&mdash;the very dream, you think,
might have generated the subsequent vision.
But it was no coincidence. It was the
operation of some mystic agency, to be
credited without questioning; an agency as
definite, though inscrutable, as the soul
which informs our being with the knowledge
of its existence, but ridicules our efforts to
give that knowledge shape."</p>

<p>"Have you ever sought to meet her
again?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have not dared."</p>

<p>"Not <i>dared</i>!"</p>

<p>"You are surprised. But I had not Hamlet's
resolution:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thy intents wicked or charitable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou comest in such questionable shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I <i>dare not</i> speak to thee!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Martelli, had I met her close again, as I
met her that night, I should have gone mad.
Her steady supernatural gaze, her rigid
mien, her shape, which united the two extremes
of spectral beauty and human sweetness,
were shocking."</p>

<p>"Would you fear to meet her if you had
a companion."</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Pray applaud my candour;
you see I confess myself a coward."</p>

<p>"It is no proof of cowardice. A brave
man might reasonably recoil from encountering
such an airy horror as enlivened your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
midnight ramble. As for me, I have no
fear of ghost or goblin. A questionable
shape would make me curious, not timid.
Here, however, we should be dealing with
no shadow. A phantom might, indeed, be
a widow, though, it is said, that owing to
the scarcity of priests, there are no marriages
in Heaven. But it would hardly bear the
name of 'Mrs. Fraser,' when it has a magnificent
mythology to choose from. At
what time did you say you met her?"</p>

<p>"It was two o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"A rather inconvenient hour," he exclaimed
with a laugh. "Would not ten or
eleven o'clock suit her as well? But it is
enough that she should be a woman to be
perverse. If you think that there is any
chance of our meeting her to-night, I should
be glad to accompany you. Two heads are
better than one in a business of this kind."</p>

<p>"I am willing to go. Yet there is no
reason why she should be there."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>"We shall have the moon with us, at all
events," he said; "for there she is, crawling
up yonder, though with a sinister disc."</p>

<p>He pointed to the trees, above which the
moon, large, red, and dim, like a cloud
shone on by the expiring sun, was slowly
sailing up.</p>

<p>"It is now half-past ten," I remarked.
"It may prove after all a fool's errand.
However we can sip our grog and stroll
out afterwards, if you like&mdash;go, at all events,
to the fields, and linger in the cool till you
shall think proper to return."</p>

<p>He consented, though assuring me it
would be no inconvenience to him to sit
through the night. He was anxious, he
added, that I should have my mind cleared
of the odd fancies that encumbered it; and
very proud and happy would it make him
to believe that he had been instrumental in
solving any problem that perplexed, or
helping forward any desires that agitated me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>I did not doubt, though he was cautious
not to suggest, that he thought me a very
odd, fanciful, even half-crazy being. A
downright practical intrigue, a transparent
love-affair, he could very readily have understood;
but a passion excited by meeting a
woman under circumstances so strange, a
love inflamed by superstition and yet made
imbecile by timidity, it was not in his
nature to comprehend. It was fortunate
perhaps that his polite incredulity curbed
my natural tendency to rhapsodise, or I
might have written myself down a greater
ass in his eyes than he was disposed to think
me.</p>

<p>We left the house at an hour considerably
past the appointed time. Sitting over our
brandy-and-water we had fallen into an argument,
and had prosecuted it with an industry
and enthusiasm that had made us
forgetful of the clock. He was the first to
recall our scheme.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>"See!" he exclaimed, "it is twenty
minutes to twelve; close upon the hour
when churchyards yawn."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said I; "but lest we encounter
more than our nerves&mdash;<i>my</i> nerves at
all events&mdash;are prepared to meet, let us take
one glass more."</p>

<p>He refused with a smile. I brimmed a
tumbler.</p>

<p>"<i>Ai mali extremi, extremi remedi</i>," said he,
laughing.</p>

<p>"You may need the remedy yourself yet,"
I retorted, as I led the way into the
garden.</p>

<p>The air was so silent that, as we marched
with soundless tread upon the velvet lawn,
I could hear the rustle of an occasional leaf
falling from the branches. Among the
trees the moon threw level beams, that lay
like fallen marble columns. The shadows
were swart and stirless.</p>

<p>I was kept silent by my thoughts. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was loquacious. We gained the end of the
grounds, passed through the gate, and
entered the fields.</p>

<p>"What an oppressive night!" he exclaimed,
removing his hat and fanning himself
with it. "The moon seems hardly able
to pierce her light through the sultry air.
I should have thought such a temperature
impossible in fifty-five degrees north."</p>

<p>"It must end in a storm. The stars look
white and sick with the heat. Perhaps they
are paling their ineffectual fires before the
brilliance of the lightning which they can
see but we cannot."</p>

<p>We had gained the summit of the hillock
whereon I had before stood. I seated myself.</p>

<p>"There is her house, or rather there is its
position," said I, pointing to the trees. "Do
you see that hedge? She was gliding alongside
it when I saw her. Martelli, picture
yourself alone here; disposed by the drowsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
moonlight and vague murmurs in the air to
unpleasant thoughts. Suddenly a white dim
shape flits upon the gloom, pauses, vanishes,
to reappear at your elbow&mdash;would you not
use your legs?"</p>

<p>His white teeth shone beneath his black
moustache.</p>

<p>"No. It would probably be the other
who would use its legs. I should seize it&mdash;man
or woman, angel or goblin!"</p>

<p>"Then your nerves must be of galvanised
wire, your muscles iron, your spirit something
more surprising than the timid essence
that vitalises such a lower order of being
as I."</p>

<p>He smoked the cheroot I had given him,
without response.</p>

<p>I lay back with my head reposing on
my arm, my eyes fixed on the stars.</p>

<p>"Look!" he suddenly cried; "there is
your spirit!"</p>

<p>I started&mdash;rose to my feet at once. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
stood, habited as I had before seen her,
at the gate of the garden, motionless.</p>

<p>Martelli advanced, paused, beckoned. I
went to him.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to her?" he whispered.
"If she sees us she will withdraw."</p>

<p>"She will not see us."</p>

<p>He laughed low.</p>

<p>"She must be blind if she doesn't. But
now is your opportunity to speak with her.
Come with me&mdash;be bold, Sir. This is a
rare chance. Should she not see us until
we are near, and then attempt to withdraw,
accost her bravely. Tell her you have met
her here before&mdash;acquaint her with your
alarm. The rest is easy."</p>

<p>He moved forward; I followed. The
moon gave us sharp, short shadows. I
breathed quickly. He heard my pantings,
and took my arm.</p>

<p>She stood confronting us; but she did
not stir. We drew near. I who knew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
face, could shape from the countenance,
whose lineaments were yet too dim to discern,
the sorrowful sovereign eyes and
immobile beauty.</p>

<p>Suddenly Martelli stopped short. I looked
at him. He was staring and trembling.
His breath seemed to die. His eyes were
round and lively with an expression that
seemed to me akin to horror. I heard
him gasp "<i>Dio mio! Dio mio!</i>" several times.</p>

<p>Somehow the failure of his courage was
the renewal of mine. Much of her mystery
had at least fallen from this woman. I knew
who she was, at all events. But how
strange, how startling was it to see her
gazing steadfastly in our direction, and not
offering to move.</p>

<p>I whispered to Martelli: "Come, come!
where are your nerves?" He could not
answer me. There he stood, rooted to
the ground, with his face in the moonlight
blanched to the colour of a corpse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>At this moment the figure turned, made
a gesture with her right hand and withdrew.</p>

<p>"I will follow you!" I said, setting my
teeth, for the undertaking was a mighty one
to me. Yes! I was mastered now by a
resolution uncontrollable as superstition and
passion could make it, to speak to her. I
left Martelli and advanced to the gate. I
pushed it open, and passed up the garden
walk. Her white shape floated in front.
I trod on tiptoe, gained her side, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"I saw your summons. I am, indeed,
grateful to you for this privilege. I have
long wished for an interview, but respected
too much your obvious desire of solitude"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But here I broke off; for though I spoke
in her ear she did not turn. Had she been
a statue, she could not have been more
heedless. I was abreast of her; a stride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>took me in advance. I looked into her
face. Her eyes were fixed. In their wonderful
depth the moon was mirrored; but
they were uninformed and expressionless.
They stared from beneath her brow of ivory,
soulless and blank.</p>

<p>I halted abruptly, as Martelli had done.
She swept forward, mounted the steps leading
into the house, and vanished. I returned
to my friend. I found him leaning against
the gate. When he saw me he stood erect.
His face was still blanched; but he had
mastered himself so far as to speak in a firm
voice and to smile.</p>

<p>"She is no ghost," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"I knew that," I replied.</p>

<p>"She was very ghostly though. I can
understand your alarm."</p>

<p>"I am glad you can. Your own behaviour
justifies mine. But I thought you
were afraid of neither ghost nor goblin?"</p>

<p>"I thought she would move&mdash;I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
she would move," he replied. "Her stillness
was fearful&mdash;it was unexpected&mdash;I found
it terrible."</p>

<p>"But the mystery of her is at an
end."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, Sir. Your
ghost is nothing more than a somnambulist.
I should have guessed it from the beginning&mdash;guessed
either that she was asleep or that
she was mad. Anyone in his senses would
have hit upon this."</p>

<p>"I didn't. But perhaps I am not in my
senses."</p>

<p>"Remember, Sir, you are in love!" he
exclaimed, with a hard laugh.</p>

<p>"Who could help being in love with
such a creature? Did you remark her
beauty?"</p>

<p>"As well as I could by the light. She
did not strike me as possessing the charms
your enthusiasm would have suggested. To
be sure I saw her at a disadvantage. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
do not admire red-haired women; or if they
be red-haired, let them have at least blue
eyes. Beauty should always be harmonious.
And then she walks in her sleep&mdash;a qualification
I for one could dispense with."</p>

<p>"Let us go in," I said. "The issue
of this adventure has satisfied me. To-morrow
I will introduce myself to her."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>The resolution I had made over night
was stronger by the morning. When I
met Martelli I told him there would be no
use in sitting down to work.</p>

<p>"I foresaw this," he replied. "Perhaps
it will be better to defer your studies until
you are out of this mysterious complication,"
smiling.</p>

<p>"It will hardly be optional," I said.
"My mind is too active in a very different
direction from books to make me profit
from reading. The labour would only be
mechanical."</p>

<p>"I wish, Sir, you would direct me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
employ the interval in some way useful to
yourself. I shall be eating the bread of
idleness&mdash;a food I have little relish
for."</p>

<p>"You will be doing nothing of the sort,"
I answered; "your society gives me pleasure,
and besides, we may take a holiday
now and then, may we not? We have
done very well. In the time you have
been here, you have advanced me further
than I could have done alone in twelve
months."</p>

<p>He bowed, thanking me for my assurance,
and expressed his gratitude for the unfailing
politeness and liberal hospitality he had
enjoyed during his residence.</p>

<p>He had recovered from his surprise or
shock of the preceding night. Yet there
was upon his manners and in his expression
a shadow whose presence I could mark,
though whose meaning I could not read.
The subtle alteration would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
inappreciable to one who had watched him
less closely than I, and who had been less
often in his company. There was a light
now in his eye which had not been there
before. His energy, the swift gesture, the
sharp vanishing smile, the quick contraction
of the brow, were moderated, sobered, by a
stealthy composure. I attributed the change,
vague and slight as it was, to the fright he
had received. "This hint of unfamiliar
repose," I said to myself, "may be the
effect of repressed irritability, excited by
his last night's involuntary confession of
weakness or cowardice."</p>

<p>I had a part to play, however, which
gave my thoughts full employment.</p>

<p>I left Martelli and strolled about the
grounds until lunch-time. I then returned,
despatched a light meal, took my hat, and
left the house. Elmore Cottage was not
above five minutes' walk from my house
by the road. I could have wished it ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
times the distance. I approached it timorously,
and gazed bashfully under the concealment
of the hedge. It was an exquisitely
clean little place: the walls white, the
windows burnished and draped with snowy
muslin. The lower windows were veiled
with flowers. I hoped its mistress would
not see me enter. I rather prayed that
she might be in the garden. I pushed
open the gate with a quick hand and gained
the door. My thin and doubtful appeal
with the knocker was promptly answered
by a young woman, tidy, grave, and
comely.</p>

<p>I asked for Mrs. Fraser. I was answered
that she was out.</p>

<p>"She will not be out to me," said I,
"if you will say that I am come to speak
with her on a matter of great consequence
to herself."</p>

<p>The servant eyed me shrewdly, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
not disrespectfully. "But Mrs. Fraser is
out, Sir," said she.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fraser is not out," I exclaimed
in a steady voice. "Come, allow me to
walk in. Must I repeat that I have come
to see Mrs. Fraser on very important
business?"</p>

<p>She was too well-trained to keep me
on the doorstep or even in the passage,
though I daresay she would have preferred
that I remained in the road whilst she went
to hold a council with her mistress. She
slightly smiled as she said, "What name,
Sir?"</p>

<p>"Never mind my name," I replied.
"Simply say a gentleman has called to
see her."</p>

<p>She left the room. The apartment into
which she had conducted me was close,
though the windows were open. The
furniture was old, but tasteful enough. A
piano stood in a corner, and on a chair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a pile of music. I thought of my bouquet
as my eye rested on some flowers in a vase
on the table. On either side the mirror,
over the chimney-piece, was a pencil drawing,
skilfully done, representing, the one on the
left, a calm at sea, an iceberg on the horizon,
an albatross suspended over the wreck of
a vessel, whose broken masts, trailing ropes
and vacant decks were full of the poetry
of desolation: the one on the right, a
woman seated at a table, with her face
buried in her hands, a crucifix before her.
I drew near, and read at the corner of
each drawing the word "Geraldine."</p>

<p>A longer interval than what I had anticipated
elapsed before Mrs. Fraser presented
herself. I was eyeing a little gilt dial with
some degree of impatience, when I heard a
sound behind me. I turned rapidly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fraser stood at the table, her black
eyes fixed on me with a look half of alarm,
half of embarrassment. Their startled beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was smiting. Her yellow hair was combed
high, but silken threads strayed over her
brow and behind her ears. Her lips were
compressed.</p>

<p>I rose and made her a bow.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated," she said in a low voice.
"My servant tells me you have called on a
matter of business."</p>

<p>"Not exactly <i>business</i>," I answered.
"But first, you must allow me to introduce
myself to you as Mr. Thorburn, your neighbour."</p>

<p>She regarded me earnestly. I paused:
another moment's silence would have embarrassed
me, so I said hardily:</p>

<p>"I shall wholly depend on your kindness
not to make me feel more painfully the
trying position in which I have placed
myself. The intrusion," continued I, nervousness
making my apology elaborate,
"will only seem all the more unwarrantable
when I tell you that I am fully aware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
your love of solitude and your aversion to
intruders. But"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She interrupted me, turning her back to
the window, the better to see me, and not
to be seen:</p>

<p>"You sent me a bouquet the other
day?"</p>

<p>"I ventured to take the liberty."</p>

<p>"You must have thought my rejection
rude. It was meant to be rude. How, Sir,
knowing my aversion to intruders, <i>could</i>
you have taken that liberty? Did you
think it would lead to an introduction?"</p>

<p>Her language gave me confidence. Had
she sweetly thanked me for my attention or
apologised for her rudeness, she would, I
think, have confounded me too much for
my wits. But this tone of hers brought her
down to my level. I could meet her on
equal ground.</p>

<p>"I sent you that bouquet," I answered,
"because I judged by your love of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>gardening
that you were fond of flowers. The
action was not designed as a rudeness. It
was a mere neighbourly act"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She seemed too impatient to hear me
out.</p>

<p>"How can I believe you? People never
act without design."</p>

<p>"I have explained my design," I said,
repressing a smile with difficulty.</p>

<p>Her eyes were incensed. Their beauty
made them almost unreal.</p>

<p>"You are still standing!" she exclaimed.
"I beg that you will be seated. Pray do
not mind me. I am of an excitable temperament,
and when I converse it is difficult for
me to keep still."</p>

<p>She left the window, went to the
end of the room, and gazed at me
thence, like some beautiful savage, untamed,
startled, exquisitely unconventional.</p>

<p>I borrowed her tone; she was free-spoken;
she would like free-speaking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"My apology&mdash;if apology it were&mdash;does
not contain the whole truth. But your
goodness will not allow you to think me
so great a culprit as I appear. I had met
you once; your appearance piqued me; I
desired to make your acquaintance and have
tried an experiment which I beseech you not
to render ignominious."</p>

<p>"Piqued, Sir! How were you piqued?"</p>

<p>"Piqued is not the word. But I dare
not substitute the right expression. I will
not be so rude as to utilise the privilege your
own candour confers."</p>

<p>She came over and stood opposite me.</p>

<p>"You say, Mr. Thorburn, you have met
me. That is impossible."</p>

<p>"If I prevaricated before, I am truthful
now."</p>

<p>"I have not been out of this house for
a month. Oh! I suppose you saw me from
your grounds."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>"The thick hedge and the trees that divide
us would prevent that."</p>

<p>"You may have found the means of looking
over?"</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Great as my curiosity may
have been, my politeness, I am sure, is
vigorous enough to keep it well disciplined."</p>

<p>"Curiosity! what should there be in me
to excite curiosity?"</p>

<p>"Curiosity is the daughter of admiration."</p>

<p>"I am a widow," she continued vehemently.
"I lead a sequestered life. I visit
nowhere. I receive no visits. Is it because
I am a Roman Catholic that you are curious?"</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a missionary, Mrs.
Fraser? I assure you I was ignorant of
your faith. Of your habits I know only
from the information of my housekeeper.
A fellow-feeling makes us kind. I, too, am
a recluse, loving solitude as well as yourself."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>"Impossible!" she exclaimed impetuously,
"or you would not have called here."</p>

<p>I could have told her that I loved beauty
more than solitude. But I held my tongue.</p>

<p>"Where did you meet me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I met you in the fields outside our respective
grounds."</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried. "Never have I
passed the gate that leads into those
fields."</p>

<p>There was something singular in her
vehemence. But it made her beauty more
remarkable by the life it imparted to it.</p>

<p>"But this has been told me before," she
continued rapidly. "Yes, I remember.
Your housekeeper asked my servant if I
were not in the habit of taking midnight
rambles. Oh, how can you justify the rudeness
of such questions?"</p>

<p>"They were asked unknown to myself.
Be sure, I should never have sanctioned
them, if I had questions to ask, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
be bold, and interrogate you, not your
domestic."</p>

<p>"Questions to ask! What are you to
me that you should question me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I am to you no more than
your servant is to me. But you are something
to me. Is it possible, do you think,
that I could look upon your face without
interest?"</p>

<p>"How should I know&mdash;why should I
care?" she replied, her nostrils dilated, her
lips curved, her eyes radiant with the light
of anger qualified by surprise&mdash;of resentment
tempered by curiosity. "You say you met
me&mdash;you are long in telling your story."</p>

<p>"It was one moonlight night. I walked
to the fields, and had seated myself, when I
saw you pacing the walk by the hedge.
Twice you went the length of it&mdash;then disappeared."</p>

<p>She seated herself in a chair facing mine,
leaned her chin upon her small white hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and gazed at me with a look of earnestness
that was embarrassing in its intensity. The
pressure upon her chin made her speak
through her teeth as she said,</p>

<p>"You must have dreamed this?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I did not. But I own I dreamt
of you before. I dreamt that you looked
upon me in a vision. I saw your eyes.
They were not more wonderful in that vision
than they are in life. Your face was paler
than it is now."</p>

<p>She did not alter her position.</p>

<p>"A few hours after this dream I saw
you. The spirit I had seen in my sleep
stood before me in the flesh. This singular
realisation of my vision made a deep impression.
Its natural consequence was a
great eagerness to know you. But how
could I intrude? under what pretext could
I force myself upon you? Last night I
found an excuse&mdash;I met you again."</p>

<p>"How strange!" she muttered. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
dropped her forehead upon her hand and
her deep eyes shone upon me through their
long lashes.</p>

<p>"When I met you last night," I continued,
"I was not alone. A companion was with
me. You appeared to us as you had
appeared to me. He saw you, and if you
doubt the truth of what I say, will bear
testimony. You stood at the gate; your
eyes were fixed and your countenance turned
towards us."</p>

<p>A look of distress entered her face.</p>

<p>"I did not know that I still walked in my
sleep," she said.</p>

<p>"It is a dangerous habit, Mrs. Fraser."</p>

<p>"I will give directions to my servant. I
am grateful to you <i>now</i> for your visit. I
see you did not design to do me a rudeness.
I should have received you more courteously;
but I am not always my own mistress."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" I answered; "your candour
is too charming to require excuses. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
must believe that such ingenuousness is very
refreshing to one who, like myself, has
wasted the best part of his days amid sophisticated
and conventional society, where truth
is never possible because it must always be
offensive."</p>

<p>"Don't you find it dull at Elmore Court?"</p>

<p>"No; I spend the greater portion of my
time in reading. Besides, I have a companion&mdash;a
gentleman accomplished enough
to be of great use to me in my studies."</p>

<p>"You are a young man," she said, eyeing
me intently, "and it is unusual for young
men to banish themselves from life and its
pleasures, especially if they have money."</p>

<p>"I admire your incredulity," I answered,
laughing, "for it gives me an excuse to tell
you more of myself than I could otherwise
have done. I mean, that a voluntary confession
would have smacked rather egotistic."</p>

<p>She left her chair and began to pace up
and down the room. I was fascinated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her form, the beautiful curve of her breast,
the proportioned waist, her erect stature,
and the unconscious grace of her movements.
When her face was towards me her eyes
were invariably on mine; there was in them
an unsmiling sparkle, a grave glow, that
gave unreality to their gaze, a spectral beauty
to their depths.</p>

<p>"I took Elmore Court," I continued,
"not because I was tired of, but because I
wanted to enjoy, life."</p>

<p>"You thought that abstinence would
create appetite?"</p>

<p>"I wished to learn the art of living;
and this, I saw, was only to be accomplished
by study, by thought, and by awakening
aspirations which should be lofty enough to
make their achievement laborious."</p>

<p>"What do you hope to do?"</p>

<p>"Much."</p>

<p>"You will do little. Ah! you think I
mean that you have no talent? I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
said so. How should I know your gifts
and deficiencies? But life itself is one huge
disappointment. The more laborious the
effort the more dreadful the failure. Pray
don't fancy I think only of books, or art,
or science. I know nothing of these things;
and they make but a very small portion of
life. I have the passions in my mind&mdash;love,
hope, patience and the like&mdash;all these things
end in regret."</p>

<p>"Your logic is very dispiriting," said I,
watching her with increasing admiration.
"It would leave life nerveless, and make
death its only aspiration."</p>

<p>"Do you think life ends in death?"</p>

<p>"The life of the flesh, certainly."</p>

<p>"The flesh has nothing to do with life.
It is the spirit that lives. My flesh might
have been dead last night when you saw
me: for I heard and felt nothing. No!
it was all as blank to me as my sight when I
shut my eyes so;" she closed her eyes like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
child would have done. "I might have
been dead, and to myself was as dead
as ever I shall be when I am in the
grave."</p>

<p>I was about to speak, when she suddenly
said, "Mr. Thorburn, you are making a
long call."</p>

<p>"I must plead you as my excuse," I
answered, rising, hardly knowing whether to
look grave or smile, so bewildered was I
by her manners and conversation: her
brusquerie, of which her beauty qualified
the rudeness; her severity, tempered by a
childishness which made all her moods but
new points of view of her charms.</p>

<p>I took my hat: she opened the door.</p>

<p>"I hope, Mrs. Fraser," said I, "that you
will not deny me the pleasure of meeting you
again?"</p>

<p>"I have not come to Cliffegate for society,
Mr. Thorburn."</p>

<p>"Nor I. But a single individual does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
make society. Besides, would not my having
met you twice under circumstances so uncommon
justify my claiming a privilege
to which no one else in this place could
pretend?"</p>

<p>"What privilege?"</p>

<p>"The privilege of knowing you and meeting
you. It was, at least, promised me in
a dream. You will not set aside a promise
so mysterious?"</p>

<p>"Are you a fatalist? I am. If you are
not, you will ridicule my <i>weakness</i>, as you
will call it. But much may be forgiven to
persons who lead such self-contained lives as
I. So, if we are to become friends, our
friendship is preordained, and my rebelling
against it would be foolish."</p>

<p>"If we are to be friends, I shall become
a fatalist. A creed made tempting by such
a reward is irresistible. I have your permission
to call again?"</p>

<p>"You are your own master."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>The reply was sufficient. I extended my
hand; she gave me hers. I held it for a
moment, and we separated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>Martelli was in the library when I
entered. He sat deep in an arm-chair, his
legs crossed, his face hid behind a folio.</p>

<p>"I have seen my apparition," said I
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I guessed so by the time you were
absent," he answered, looking at the
clock.</p>

<p>"I hope my resolute behaviour vindicates
my courage, or at least excuses my former
fears."</p>

<p>"You have renewed the pretty ancient
legend, and have changed your shape of
marble into a breathing woman. It certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
shows some hardihood and much tact to
have penetrated into her presence. She
seems, by your account, to have taken the
white veil of solitude, and is dead to all
the world."</p>

<p>"After an interview with a beautiful
woman," I cried effusively, looking round
upon the bookshelves, "how flat, stale,
weary, and unprofitable appears everything
else! The dead are all very well in their
way&mdash;<i>nil nisi bonum</i>&mdash;but there is something
in the large black eye of a woman&mdash;a
divinity, a power, an inspiration&mdash;that makes
poetry, philosophy and the fine arts very
second-rate, somehow."</p>

<p>"No, Sir; the rate is not changed; it
is a only temporary eclipse&mdash;a shadow dimming
a light."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "for my part, I adore
black eyes; I refer particularly to Mrs.
Fraser's. If I were called upon to name
the most harmonious contrast in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I should say black eyes and yellow hair.
Oh! she is the loveliest, the most fascinating,
the wildest, sweetest, strangest woman in
the wide world!"</p>

<p>"Your interview has been satisfactory, I
presume?" he remarked drily. "She must
have been prepared for your visit and met
you with the most polished and facile of her
arts.</p>

<p>"There was nothing polished or facile
about her. On the contrary, she was
rude."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what would be called rude were I
to write it down. But you know I am a
bit of a gourmand and relish pungent condiments.
Her manner is indeed the only
<i>sauce piquante</i> that would suit her beauty."</p>

<p>"'We forgive in proportion as we love,'
says Rochefoucauld, a man of the world."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive&mdash;but there
is much to love. There is a shrewd <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>sweetness
about her that took me mightily.
Solitude has made her primitive. Had
Byron met her we should have had a poem
on the beautiful savage, with her coy and
mutinous manners, with the light of golden
sands upon her hair and the shine of torrid
suns upon her eyes. Hear me now,
Martelli, and marvel!" I continued, striking
a heroic attitude. "When she speaks she
looks like liberty incarnate; there is freedom
in her royal gestures; pliancy and power
in her step; her exquisite form undulates
to her thoughts like the shadow of a dryad
seen in a breezy pool!"</p>

<p>"This, Sir, is love. Your language has
about it the poetic ambiguity that no other
passion would dictate."</p>

<p>"It is love! I avow it. I am in love with
this woman."</p>

<p>"I think I can understand you, Sir. You
have cultivated this emotion for the purpose
of utilising it. You are giving it full licence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
that you may properly observe its operation.
When fully developed, you will anatomise
it, study its conformation, and having enlarged
your knowledge of human nature
by the examination, bury the corpse of the
passion as the doctors bury the subjects they
have dissected."</p>

<p>"No, this is not my intention," I answered,
laughing heartily; "emotion is too valuable
to be wasted in the pursuit of knowledge."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir, but&mdash;do you propose
to marry her?"</p>

<p>"If she will have me."</p>

<p>"She is to be congratulated on her beauty.
It must be of a rare and powerful kind to
strike love at one blow into a heart which
I thought was surfeited with this sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"Her beauty is rare and powerful
too."</p>

<p>"It must be, to achieve such a victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
over the experience that had driven you
into the cool and calm dominion of intellectual
love."</p>

<p>"Can I not occupy both dominions?
Must intellect be denied me because I
fall in love?" I asked, attributing the sarcastic
emphasis of his language to a fear
that my marriage would lose him his
situation.</p>

<p>"I think not," he answered. "My experience
of knowledge is, that it is a jealous
god. Surely, Sir, your resolution is abrupt!
You have declared your intention only to
excite my wonder!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am quite sincere
when I tell you that I am head over heels
in love with this woman, and that I would
marry her to-morrow if I thought she would
accept me."</p>

<p>He rose, went to the window, stared out
for some moments, and then approached
me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>"If I understood you aright, Mr. Thorburn,
your object in residing here was to
enable you to lay in such a stock of knowledge
as would enable you to contest for
fame with a good promise of success?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"You even went, Sir, to the expense of
furnishing this house, that you might burden
yourself with obligations which should not
be got rid of without inconvenience and loss."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"That you did, that your resolution,
should it grow impaired by fatigue or caprice,
would still be hampered with difficulties
enough to make its decay slow or even
impossible."</p>

<p>"Well?" said I, wondering at his solemnity
and long preamble.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Sir, I ask respectfully,
that you will abandon your large and dignified
enterprise for a lady of whom you know
nothing?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>"You only make me sensible of the
capriciousness of my character," I answered,
laughing; "but you could not shake the love
this lady has inspired."</p>

<p>"Sir," he said courteously, "nothing
would justify the freedom of my language
but the knowledge that one of the duties
you desired me to discharge, was to stimulate
your energies when I found them flagging.
But as you have determined to alter your
views, I shall of course consider those duties
at an end."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked. "What avenues in
life would be closed to me as a married man
that are opened to me as a bachelor? A
man is not bound to be idle, is not prohibited
from meditating as ambitiously as
he chooses, because he gives his name to a
woman."</p>

<p>"I do not say, Sir, that you may not
recur hereafter to your schemes; but you
may reckon on being very indisposed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
study for a good time now. This lady will
occupy your thoughts to the exclusion of
all things else, before marriage and for long
after. Love-making is an absorbing occupation.
To a poor man it may be a stimulus,
for he may have to work in order to
wed; but to a rich man it is usually a
soporific."</p>

<p>"My good friend," I exclaimed, "you
speak as though my marriage were a fixed
matter. Let us look at the truth. I am
in love with this lady, it is true&mdash;but she is
not in love with me. I may have to be importunate
to procure her consent&mdash;should
she ever vouchsafe her consent, which,
between you and me, I have no earthly
reason to suppose likely; and importunities,
to be successful, must be often delayed and
never vehement. I should regret your
leaving me; and should regret it the more
if you resolve to go before my future takes
a more definite character. My wishes will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of course impel me to bring this love of
mine to an issue as speedily as she will let
me; but I really like your company too
well to wish you to regulate your conduct
by a contingency which, I fear, may
prove the reverse of inevitable."</p>

<p>He paced the room, eyeing me from
time to time with a gaze uncertain and
agitated. His brow was clouded.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful to you for your
kindness to me," he said, "and I will avail
myself of it to think a little before I decide.
I shall be selfish enough to hope that your
marriage will not happen. We have been
going on well&mdash;very well. It would be
a pity that this pleasant life should be disturbed.
I am much obliged to you for
your courtesy," he repeated, "and you are
very kind to have listened to my plain-speaking
so good-naturedly."</p>

<p>To this I made some reply, and the
subject dropped.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>"Here," thought I, "is an illustration
of the genuine southern character: the warm
and sudden humours; the irritable pets and
fumes; the querulous misgivings; the effusive
gratitude; the morbid distrust. Here
too, is a living example of the penalty of
thought. The brain of this smart little man
has been playing so long and so remorselessly
on his nerves, that they have at last grown
unfit for use. Coffee and tobacco, too,
have done their part, and have converted
this sallow being into a bundle of shuddering
sensibilities. Because I talk of being in love,
because I dare to dream of marrying, he
believes that I wish him to be gone. He
transforms my hopes into hints; and fearful,
perhaps, of a direct dismissal which would
convulse his dignity with mortification, and
leave his nerves flabby and toneless for ever,
he bids me understand that he considers
his duties at an end. But he'll get over
this pique. Those keen eyes, that pungent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
tongue, are the harbingers of no silly spirit.
He will contrast this house with his attic
in Berners Street, this sweet air with the
yellow element of London, his meagre
meals with his present bountiful repasts, and
will discover no urgent necessity to depart.
For myself, I doubt if I could better him.
Use has fathered one or two angularities,
and I find him now not only agreeable, but
necessary."</p>

<p>But, to be candid, these thoughts did
not long trouble me. I had my beautiful
neighbour to muse on, and she was an
inspiration that fully filled my mind.</p>

<p>Three days passed before I saw her
again.</p>

<p>Martelli had gone to Cliffegate for a
walk: I amused myself in the garden. The
grounds were now in complete order. In
the front the fountain had been repaired and
redecorated, and now tossed its pearl-shower
in the sun, circling the cool and brimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
basin with a rainbow. In the back, the
trees hung heavy with fruit. The beds were
draped with flowers. The lawn, shorn and
trimmed to velvet smoothness, offered a
pleasant relief to the eye.</p>

<p>I strolled to the end of the grounds and
inspected the brilliant <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>. My
thoughts went further than I: I wished I
could have followed them!</p>

<p>"She who loves flowers so well, what
would she think of this brilliant show?
Were I to ask her to come and see my
grounds, would she come?"</p>

<p>At that moment I heard her voice calling
to the servant from the garden. An idea
struck me. I pushed open the gate and
entered the fields. Through the gate of
her own garden I could see her. She was
raking a bed of geraniums. Her fair face
was shadowed by a hat, broad-brimmed and
high-crowned; inelegant it would have
looked on many a woman; but the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
fastidious taste would have been ravished
by its becoming elegance on her. The skirt
of her dress, pinned up, disclosed a foot
matchless in its turn and shape. What
grace was in the movement of her arms!
how delicate the outline of her inclined
form! A long curl of gold had slipped
from the blue ribbon that bound her hair
and reposed like a sunbeam on her back. I
stood watching her with all my soul in my
gaze. A lark rose shrilling from the fields,
and soared, pouring its throat in a strain
chastened by the nimble air. She drew
herself erect, and protecting her eyes, sought
the bird in the blue. Her full and shapely
form, her black and luminous eyes, shaded
by her hand of snow, her yellow hair, her
looped skirt, her firm small feet, made, as
she stood among the flowers, such a picture
of colour, beauty, and sunshine as I must
never hope to see again.</p>

<p>I drew to the gate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Mrs. Fraser," I said
gently.</p>

<p>She started, and seeing me, stared without
speaking.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not alarmed you," I said,
observing the startled expression of her eyes
to brighten with a sudden angry light: "I
was attracted by the sound of your voice,
and would not miss this chance of seeing
you."</p>

<p>She let fall the rake and came to the gate.</p>

<p>"How long have you been there?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Some minutes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Watching! watching! Mr. Thorburn,
I am sorry you ever took Elmore Court.
Before you came, my privacy here was as
sacred as though this garden had been
cloisters."</p>

<p>"Have I violated it?"</p>

<p>"Of course you have. Have you not
been watching me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>"I must offer you no apology. If I desire
to win your approbation, I must not cloud or
varnish my meaning."</p>

<p>"It would not be worth while."</p>

<p>"So I will admit that I came here not
only with the intention of seeing, but of
speaking to you. Now is my crime very
grave?"</p>

<p>"Are you beginning to feel dull?" she
asked, eyeing me with embarrassing earnestness.
"Are your beginning to grow weary
of books and thoughts, and to discover that
the most tiresome and indiscreet companion
a man can choose is himself? If so, why
do you not return to London? You must
have the means to purchase the distractions
which are called pleasures."</p>

<p>"Indeed"&mdash;I began.</p>

<p>"Or," she went on with odd imperturbability,
"if you can't conveniently leave
Elmore Court, there are, I believe, people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
here whom you might easily get to know.
Why me, Mr. Thorburn? why <i>me</i>?" she
exclaimed, with a little stamp of her
foot.</p>

<p>"Who are the people, Mrs. Fraser?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said wearily,
"I have never inquired. I have shunned
them always. Some of them called. I have
their cards by me somewhere. But I never
returned their visits."</p>

<p>"And I have some of their cards by me
too; and I have never returned their calls.
Such society as they offer does not suit me.
Besides, I didn't come here for society."</p>

<p>"But you seek mine."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," I said.</p>

<p>She left the gate. I thought she was
going away. She picked a flower&mdash;a white
rose, half budded&mdash;and brought it me.</p>

<p>"This is of my own planting," said she,
applying the pearly petals to her delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
nostrils: "all the flowers that you see here
are of my own planting."</p>

<p>"That bud should symbolise your life,
Mrs. Fraser."</p>

<p>She opened wide her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is unfolding its beauty and sweetness
to other eyes than its own. So should
you."</p>

<p>She flung it from her. Her under lip
pouted as though she were about to
cry.</p>

<p>"If I had thought that flower would
have provoked so silly a remark, I would
not have picked it," she said.</p>

<p>She retired a step. Fearful that I had
offended and that she would leave me, I
said boldly, "I wish you would allow me
to see your flowers. I may learn some hints
for my own garden from yours. I faithfully
promise not to be poetical again."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>"You may come in," she answered,
curving her mouth into a childish smile;
"Shall I open the gate?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I can open it."</p>

<p>I entered.</p>

<p>"Please don't notice anything from where
you stand," she exclaimed, picking up the
rake; "come with me to those steps. My
flowers look best from there."</p>

<p>She stepped forward with a light bounding
gait. I could observe nothing but her exquisite
shape, her yellow hair and alabaster
neck. I think, had I held a pair of scissors,
that not thrice the number of sylphs and
gnomes which protected the perfumed locks
of the matchless Belinda could have prevented
me from ravishing the amber curl
that floated on her back.</p>

<p>She stood on the steps of the door.</p>

<p>"There," cried she, looking up at me
with the prettiest smile in the world, "now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
you will see that all the tints are meant to
blend. The roses are not blown yet; but
you can guess how pretty they will look
next to that bed of lilies. My garden will
be a rainbow of colours next month. All
the hues meet and melt into one another&mdash;from
that bed down there to the hedge."</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" I murmured, thinking of
her eyes.</p>

<p>"If it were not for my flowers," said she,
with a sudden gravity, which did not surprise
me, for I was prepared now for any
change of mood in this capricious, strange
and fascinating woman, "I think I should
go mad. You can't tell how I hate the
winter. I lie listening to the complaining
winds until they become human shapes
craving admittance and shelter from the
piercing cold. There is a winter's wind that
blows here with a strange cry!... Do
you think the winds spirits? I do <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>sometimes,
Mr. Thorburn; nothing else, you
see, sobs and cries like they do. But who
would not scream to be pierced through
and through with hail, wrapped in the
burning lightning, and shattered by the
hateful thunder?"</p>

<p>She paused, lifting her luminous eyes to
me. "You have read a good deal," said
she, "and will know more than I. Do,
please, tell me what spirits do in winter,
when the air is so frozen it cannot blow,
and when the stars have gone out under the
clouds."</p>

<p>"I assure you," I said, puzzling myself
to reconcile her language with her eyes,
which seemed to me brilliant with intelligence,
"I have never studied these matters.
I know nothing of them. They are idle
speculations, and you should not indulge in
them. They will make your solitude very
oppressive."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>"They make my solitude more than
oppressive at times. But if the winds are
tormented spirits, those flowers are good
angels. They give me as much pleasure
as the winds give me pain. All those
flowers have souls. I am quite sure of
that. But it is not pleasant to think, for
I fear one morning I shall find them all
dead through their souls having taken
wing."</p>

<p>She pushed some transparent hairs behind
her ear.</p>

<p>"I wish, Mrs. Fraser," I said, "you
would do me the favour to inspect my
garden. I employ two gardeners; but the
three of us do not approach you in the delicacy
of your taste."</p>

<p>"When do you want me to come?"</p>

<p>"Now, if you will."</p>

<p>"Not now. I must have time to consider.
I hardly ever leave my house, and then only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
for a short walk. And did not I tell you
that I visit no one?"</p>

<p>"But you will oblige me in this?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. You have no claims
on me that I should favour you more than
any one else. I will think over it, and tell
you to-morrow. Will you come to watch
me again at the gate?"</p>

<p>"If I may?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>may</i>. The fields are not
mine; and I have no right to forbid trespassers."</p>

<p>"I will come to the gate at the hour I
met you to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will accompany me over my
grounds."</p>

<p>"I shall see. Now I must go in."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, I took and retained
it.</p>

<p>"Before I leave you, Mrs. Fraser, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
you tell me that my society is not distasteful&mdash;that
you no longer look upon me as an
intruder?"</p>

<p>She did not offer to withdraw her hand.
It seemed to me, indeed, that she hardly
knew I held it.</p>

<p>"No. I am disposed to like you," she
replied. "You weren't frank at first; but
you have become frank since, and that
makes you a pleasant companion. Oh!
you will never know my abhorrence of the
cant which politeness makes men and women
talk. They treat each other like cats&mdash;stroke,
and stroke, until truth is lost in a
general purring. I like truthful people.
They need not be insulting: they can
always keep back unpleasant knowledge;
but they need not <i>lie</i>. Polite people <i>must</i>
lie."</p>

<p>I would not argue. It pleased me better
to watch the varying expressions of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
beautiful face, the soft curvings of her lips,
the graceful gestures of her hands, than to
contradict.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said.</p>

<p>"Until to-morrow," I answered.</p>

<p>Near the gate I halted to pick up the
rose-bud she had thrown from her, and
pressed it to my lips. Peeping furtively
toward the house, I saw she watched me
from the window.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>I said next day to Martelli, "You will
see Mrs. Fraser this afternoon, I hope.
She has half promised to come and look at
my flowers."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with Mrs. Fraser?"
he exclaimed with a shrug. "My business
is with books, not women. I can understand
the one, but not the other."</p>

<p>"But I want to justify my love. Her
beauty will do this for me."</p>

<p>"Have I not seen her?" he asked,
stretching out his arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, by moonlight&mdash;with blank eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and expressionless face. Her beauty by noon
is somewhat different from her beauty by
night."</p>

<p>"Sir, yellow hair and black eyes make no
charm for me."</p>

<p>"You are a Goth."</p>

<p>"When I was a young man I fell in love
once a week. That proves a catholic taste,
at all events, for my Hebes must have
varied."</p>

<p>"But you will let me introduce you to
Mrs. Fraser? You can know and like
without admiring her. You will be struck
with her conversation."</p>

<p>"Does she talk well?"</p>

<p>"She talks strangely&mdash;what Shakespeare
calls 'matter and impertinency mixed.'
Her shrewd discursiveness pleases me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir, you are willing to be
pleased."</p>

<p>"I cannot help being pleased. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>musical prattle is very different from the
sort of entertainment I am used to in other
women. Dull decorous reason I can get
anywhere. <i>Her</i> talk is rare as her
beauty."</p>

<p>"A kind of mad talk, Sir."</p>

<p>"Mad, indeed! You shall hear her
yourself and judge."</p>

<p>"Pray excuse me. I will take my pipe,
and while you enjoy your <i>tête-à-tête</i> will
search for curious objects on the beach."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," said I, somewhat
chagrined: for I wanted to witness this
chilly sceptic melting into admiration before
my beautiful neighbour's eyes.</p>

<p>There goes a disappointed man (thought
I, as I watched him enter the house). His
austerity cloaks some odd experience, I
dare swear. Could I but see into his
memory I might witness a strange drama
being played in that little theatre. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
unconscionable jilt has soured the ripe juices
of his nature; and now he spits venom at
the whole sex. Yet he makes wry faces
over his cynicism. I don't think he relishes
it much. He argues, I suppose, that the
coming of a wife will prove the going of
his occupation. He has a rich young fellow
under his charge and has no wish to surrender
him to the keeping of a woman.
So he directs his forked tongue at her in
the hope that I shall be influenced. My
little signor, you will be disappointed, if
you hope this!</p>

<p>He left the house after lunch.</p>

<p>At the proper hour I stood at the gate
in the fields and peeped over. The garden
was empty. I looked at my watch. It was
past the time at which I had met her the
day before. Twenty minutes passed. I
walked to and fro, staring at the windows
in the hope of catching a glimpse of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
face. Believing she would disappoint me,
I grew irritable. "Her conduct," I thought,
"is unladylike, to say the least. She promised
to meet me, and should come. If
she is making a fool of me how will that
Martelli exult! But it is my own fault.
Am I not an independent man? If I want
to marry, have I not but to open my arms
to have them filled without the trouble of
wooing? For how many women are there
who would not cheerfully do all the courting
for two thousand pounds a year? Then
what do I here, in a hot field, tormented
by that accursed gnat" (and here I aimed a
prodigious but idle blow at the insect)
"worrying my mind with conjectures, a
spectacle for the pert eye of the widow's
maid, who probably sits watching me from
the ambush of a window-curtain?" And I
was positively in the act of walking away,
when suddenly, from amid a row of lilac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
trees close to the gate, stepped forth&mdash;Mrs.
Fraser.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you your thoughts?" she
exclaimed, approaching me, without returning
my salutation by smile or bow.</p>

<p>"If you please," I answered, my mood
clearing in her presence as the cloudy
heavens clear when the sun shines out.</p>

<p>"Stoop your ear then."</p>

<p>I inclined my head. She leaned across
the gate and whispered, "Mrs. Fraser&mdash;&mdash; Oh!"
she cried, springing back, and clapping
her hands, "there are some words that
are coarse and burning in the mouth as
radishes. This is one. But it's true&mdash;and
truth must be pungent."</p>

<p>"But before I can tell whether it is
true or not, let me know what you
think."</p>

<p>"Don't you think me&mdash;a humbug?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" I exclaimed with a laugh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why do you say no?" with sudden
earnestness.</p>

<p>"But I may tell you I was annoyed,"
I continued, "because I feared you would
not come."</p>

<p>"I expected you would be, and so I
determined to watch you. <i>You</i> watched
me yesterday. It was not fair. When one
is alone one indulges in all kinds of moods;
and you might have seen me make myself
ugly and foolish by pouting, grimacing,
frowning, or smiling, just as the mood
obliged me. I don't like to be caught
unawares. I choose to smooth my face
down so," looking gravely, "when I am
watched. There is an expression I wear as
a vizor; it's this."</p>

<p>As a three-year old child looks, who,
being told not to smile, frowns, that it
may appear grave, so looked she. Then,
breaking into a sudden smile:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>"I watched you frown. You stared at
my poor little house as though you could
have burnt it up with your eyes. How
you flung your impatience at the tiny fly
that annoyed you! 'Oh this treacherous
woman!' you thought; 'how glibly she
made the word of promise to the ear to
break it to the hope!' Did you not think
all this and as much more as would take me
twenty minutes to tell? I watched you
just as steadily as you watched me yesterday.
I saw your weakness. Did you see mine?
No&mdash;my hat hid my face. You couldn't
see my eyes. And unless you see the eyes
you can't tell what is going on in the mind."</p>

<p>"No, nor when you see the eyes can
you always tell what is going on. It would
be a delightful privilege," said I, looking
steadily at her, "to be able to interpret
those fiery hieroglyphics in which the soul
writes her thoughts upon the eyes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't think so," she replied. "There
would be little pleasure in life if we could
read one another's thoughts."</p>

<p>"There would be no hypocrisy, at all
events; we should have to speak the
truth."</p>

<p>"And would you like that?" she asked.
"Would the plain heiress like to hear her
lover declare that his only motive in offering
her marriage was to get her money? Would
the father like to hear that the reason of
his son's affection is that he may not be
forgotten in his will? Life is a great mirage.
Let it alone&mdash;pray, let it alone. Don't
pour the light of truth on it, or it will
vanish like a rainbow when the storm is
over."</p>

<p>"I thought, Mrs. Fraser, you were so
enamoured of truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, among my friends. It pleases me
to speak the truth, and I choose to hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
truth spoken. I hate compliments, and fine
language, and the gingerbread splendour of
<i>politeness</i>, as it is called. But it is not
because I love truth that I would rob the
world, which I hate, of the pleasure of telling
lies."</p>

<p>"You spoke of my weakness just now.
What weakness did my face or behaviour
illustrate?"</p>

<p>"Impatience."</p>

<p>"Nothing worse?"</p>

<p>"If I had remarked anything worse, I
should have let you go away."</p>

<p>"Allow me to open this gate. You will
come and see my flowers?"</p>

<p>"It would not be fair in me to
refuse you after keeping you waiting so
long."</p>

<p>I held the gate open. She passed from
her garden into mine.</p>

<p>"These grounds present no such pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> as yours," I said. "I am new at
this sort of work, and for all I know my
taste may be a little cockneyfied."</p>

<p>"Oh, but the garden is in beautiful order!
Pray do not speak to me of my poor little
slip of ground. That lawn is larger." We
paced through the walks. I could hardly
remove my eyes from her face. She had
replaced her hat of yesterday by one resembling
that worn by Peg Woffington in
Reynolds's picture. Her dress was black
silk, with a muslin body. A carved ivory
cross hung on her bosom by a chain of white
coral.</p>

<p>"Your presence here gives me great
happiness," I exclaimed; "and it makes me
proud to think that I should have been the
first to cause you to break through your
rule of solitude."</p>

<p>"I have lived here a long time now, and
you are the only person I know," she
answered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>"But you must have felt dull sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Often. How should I help feeling dull?
I have no one to speak to."</p>

<p>"But this must be your own fault," I
said gently. "You might easily have made
acquaintances."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I would not risk it. I might
not like them, and in a small place like this
it is embarrassing to withdraw from society
after one has mingled in it. Besides, people
are apt to be impertinent when they have
nothing to do. A widow is always an object
of curiosity, especially to elderly spinsters&mdash;and
there are many here. Now I will let
any one discuss me to her heart's content&mdash;on
one condition: that we remain strangers.
Oh, what a glorious rose, Mr. Thorburn!"</p>

<p>I separated it from the tree and gave it
to her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>"You should have offered it more
timidly," she exclaimed, looking at me over
the flower; "how did you know I would
not reject it like I did your bouquet?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think. But you recall my
wish to send you some flowers. Will you
let me order the gardener to make you a
bouquet?"</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>I called to one of the men and gave
him the instructions. We got upon the
lawn.</p>

<p>"What a pretty house!" she said, looking
up. "It stands so cool and white from
the road. What made you take it?"</p>

<p>"I got tired of London. I wanted to
study."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember&mdash;you told me. Do
you study now?"</p>

<p>"Not much, I fear."</p>

<p>"Where do you study?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>"In my library there," said I, pointing
to the window.</p>

<p>"You ought to be there now. I am
keeping you from your books," she exclaimed,
with a certain grave archness.</p>

<p>"You would be keeping me from my
books, whether you were absent or present."</p>

<p>"Should I? How?"</p>

<p>"By making me think of you."</p>

<p>"And do you really think of me, Mr.
Thorburn?"</p>

<p>"You have never been out of my mind
since the evening I dreamt of you."</p>

<p>"It was curious you should have dreamed
of me," she said, putting her hands behind
her and leaning against the back of a garden-seat.</p>

<p>"It was mysterious," I answered gravely.</p>

<p>"And was my face in your dream exactly
like it is here?" she asked, looking up that
I might see her fully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was more sad. You had a brokenhearted
look in your eyes. What I saw in
my dream was more like your face in your
sleep, when I met you afterwards."</p>

<p>"What made you dream of me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Had you ever seen me?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Nor heard me described?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How quickly the swallows fly!" she
exclaimed, pointing in the air. "What
would you give to be able to live all day
long in that pure blue? This is a beautiful
rose you have given me. How can the
thick, ugly, common earth yield such lovely
things?"</p>

<p>"You were questioning me, Mrs. Fraser.
Do continue your examination."</p>

<p>"Questioning you? What about?" she
asked, looking at me with a little bewildered
air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>"About my dream. I have often wanted
to discuss it with you, that I may understand
it. You who inspired it should know what
it means."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, indeed. I did not
inspire it. I had never seen you nor heard
of you."</p>

<p>"In the olden times it was the custom
to examine dreams, in the belief that they
were prophecies. I would like to revive
the custom, to see what my dream forebodes."</p>

<p>"What should it forebode? Sadness,
perhaps, since my eyes were so sad."</p>

<p>"Dreams go by contraries, they say."</p>

<p>"Then they are useless as prophecies."</p>

<p>"But I am by no means disposed to let
my dream slip by so easily. I choose to
think it significant in some sense which I
wish explained."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was a prophecy, perhaps, that you
should meet me: and you did."</p>

<p>"It was a prophecy perhaps, that our
lives were to mingle, and they may."</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible," she answered
quietly.</p>

<p>She did not say this consciously. It was
an answer obviously made without the
slightest reference to its implication.</p>

<p>"How beautiful these grounds of yours
look under the blue sky," she continued
gaily. "I wish you had not made me see
them. They will spoil me for my narrow
garden."</p>

<p>"Why will you not use them as your
own? Those gates were made for communication.
You can always be alone by
naming the hours it may suit you to come.
I can dismiss the gardeners for that time,
and hide myself in my study."</p>

<p>"Your offer is very polite, but I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
accept it. I shouldn't care to wander about
a place that doesn't belong to me; for there
is little real satisfaction in admiring the
possessions of others. Besides, my fingers
would itch to be at the flowers. I should
be picking the choicest. That is my
way."</p>

<p>"You would be welcome to pick them
all."</p>

<p>"Yet were I to come I would not wish
you to hide yourself. Your company does
me good. I have felt more cheerful since I
knew you."</p>

<p>"You give me great pleasure in saying
this, Mrs. Fraser."</p>

<p>"I mean it. I find you frank and easy
and kind. You are not in the least tiresome.
When you first spoke to me I saw
your face set out with compliments and
<i>mots</i>, like any other man's might have been.
But I swept this sugary French repast away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and made you substitute hearty nourishing
solids. This makes you agreeable."</p>

<p>Her grave innocent look forbade me to
smile; yet it was not easy to preserve my
gravity. I felt like a big boy lectured by
some pretty little girl.</p>

<p>She stood looking pensively at her foot,
which she waved to and fro on the heel;
then exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I am going now."</p>

<p>I had no wish to part with her.</p>

<p>"Pray don't go yet. We have not been
long together."</p>

<p>"No, not very long. But taste is refined
by abstinence."</p>

<p>"Yes, but this sort of refinement is
fretting. Your company is like that sweet
wine, mentioned by a Persian poet, of which
the more you drank the thirstier you became."</p>

<p>"Oh! here comes the gardener with my
bouquet!" she cried.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>The man presented it to her, cap in
hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," she exclaimed,
inclining her sweet face over the flowers.
And when the man had withdrawn, she drew
close to me, and pointing with a white finger
to the bouquet, said:</p>

<p>"Have you ever imagined what shapes
and expressions the spirits of flowers take?
The spirit of the lily would be a languid
floating shape, with meek eyes and hands
crossed on her bosom: but of course very,
very small&mdash;smaller than the fairies. The
violet would be a little baby boy with round
blue eyes and a wee red mouth. The rose
would be a young girl with a rich complexion.
Her beautiful limbs would be
tinted with a delicate pink like the shadow
of the red rose in water. She would be
haughty, with a glowing eye; and her
hair would be bound by a circle of gold."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>"And what flower," I asked, "should,
at its death, take the form of a woman
exquisitely modelled, with black eyes melting
from one sweet expression into another,
sometimes startled, sometimes pleading,
always luminous with bright but tender alternations
of thought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see," she interrupted gravely; "you
agree with me; you believe in the resurrection
of the flowers."</p>

<p>"I think you could make me believe in
anything."</p>

<p>She uttered a laugh; its abruptness made
it discordant.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she exclaimed, "I will
come and see your flowers again some
day."</p>

<p>"May I not show you over my
house?"</p>

<p>"What is there to be seen?"</p>

<p>"Come and judge."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>I held the door open; she paused, entered,
and returned.</p>

<p>"I'll not look over your house to-day.
You have had enough of my company.
You may walk with me to the gate."</p>

<p>She moved away, I followed her.</p>

<p>"How long do you think my bouquet
will last, Mr. Thorburn?"</p>

<p>"Some days."</p>

<p>"I wonder that people who like one
another should make presents of flowers.
When a young man presents a bouquet to
the girl he is in love with, do either of them
think that the gift exactly typifies their
passion&mdash;all human passion&mdash;which is bright
to-day and withered to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"They would hardly think this. I can
understand love seeking for expression in
the most lovely and fragrant symbols the
world has to offer. But the real truth is,
the majority of lovers don't think at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
They imitate. They give what others
give."</p>

<p>"Now that is the way I like to hear
people talk," she exclaimed with a merry
laugh; "I am quite sure that the only way
to be truthful is to be cynical."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>"If I were a young and inexperienced
girl, the person on whose judgment I
should most depend would be the one who
most sincerely disbelieved in the existence of
virtue."</p>

<p>"No, no. Such an infidel would make a
bad guide."</p>

<p>"An infallible guide, you mean. How
could he err?"</p>

<p>"He would err by not being able to
grasp the full character of the world's
wickedness. He would underrate its depravity
by allowing it no virtue whatever."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't understand. This is a paradox,"
said she stopping, for we had reached the
gate. "Would you increase the world's
wickedness by making it virtuous?"</p>

<p>"Yes, up to a certain point. I speak in
the sense of Dean Swift, who said we had
all of us Christianity enough to make us hate
one another. Virtue has a very fructifying
power, and vice springs richly from its soil.
A totally wicked world is an impossibility.
That dreadful place to which we are told
sinners will be consigned cannot be utterly
wicked, or it could not exist."</p>

<p>"I almost catch your meaning, but
you don't express yourself well, Mr. Thorburn."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. I am given, I am
sorry to say, to walking round my thoughts
too much." I could have added that such
eyes as hers were not calculated to make a
man logical or even disputatious, save in a
love argument.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am then to believe that there is enough
good in the world to make it more
wicked than it would be were there no
good?"</p>

<p>"Why, having advanced my position, I
am bound to stick to it. You have said
indeed what I think, but what I would not
preach."</p>

<p>She stood lost in thought for some
moments.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorburn," she presently said, "I
think the world very, very bad; it is cold-hearted,
selfish, and dishonourable and mean
and pitiless. I see now that it could not
be all this if it had not what it calls virtue
and religion to prompt it; for the virtue
of the world teaches us to hate those whom
it pronounces corrupt; and its religion"&mdash;&mdash;she
stopped with a bewildered look; "what
does its religion teach?"</p>

<p>"History will answer that better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
I. But what have we to do with the
world, Mrs. Fraser? Here, under that
tender sky, amid these flowers, fanned by
this soft air, we should not let thoughts
of its wrongs and treacheries trouble us."</p>

<p>"If one could throw memory upon the
air and bid the breeze bear its burden a
thousand miles away, then would it be well.
But the afternoon is passing. Good-bye,
Mr. Thorburn."</p>

<p>"When may I see you again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you will find a time," she answered
with a little demure laugh; and so saying
she passed through the gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Her manners, her moods, her beauty
had fascinated me. My love for her was
become a passion. I determined before long
to declare it. But before doing so, I
resolved to see more of her. I wanted to
be sure that she loved me before I proposed.
I felt my happiness would be staked on the
issue of the offer, and dreaded the result of
hasty action.</p>

<p>You may believe I thought very hard
over the problem of her nature; but I
could arrive at no solution that satisfied
me. She had affirmed that she liked my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
company; but the assurance had been too
much qualified by the <i>naïveté</i> of the declaration
to be pleasing. A better illustration,
at least a more satisfactory indication, lay in
her not avoiding me.</p>

<p>But what an odd character was hers!
How inadequate is language to represent
her! I can only give you the bare uncoloured
outline. It is beyond my power
to fill it up with the details which must
be accurately painted, before you can have
before you, as I knew her, my beautiful,
wayward, fantastical, child-like neighbour.</p>

<p>I suppose my love blinded me, or I
should have attached more importance to
the various little perplexing points of character
which stole out during our conversations.
Her candour was made too
piquant by her eyes, her downright utterances
too musical by her voice, her rapid
divergence from one topic to another too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pretty by the infantine air that accompanied
it, to suffer me to note any other meaning
than that which met the eye and ear.</p>

<p>I laid aside my books and my ambitions
in my pursuit of her. Compared with
winning her, all other pleasures and hopes
were poor and small indeed. My love
engrossed my thoughts, held me absent;
and made me altogether more foolish than my
sense of self-respect will suffer me to recall.</p>

<p>She was right when she told me I should
find a time to meet her. I met her the
next day. I met her the day after; and
upon succeeding days again. Once I prevailed
upon her to accompany me in a walk
to the cliffs, by an unfrequented road leading
to a spot where we stood in little danger
of being intruded on. It was on this
occasion that I witnessed in her more constrained
air, in her speech more suave than
usual, in her eyes which were sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
shyly averted, the presence of an emotion
I had waited for and sought to excite.
The breakers creamed at our feet; a west
wind cooled the air; the white gulls swept
by on curved and steady wings; the sun
reared an unbroken silver pillar in the
sea. The scene, the sounds, the solitude
were propitious to love; but I would not
speak my feelings yet. I felt that the
memory of this calm and tender hour we
were passing together would do more
for me than I could do for myself.</p>

<p>During the week Martelli and I had been
little together. My mind had been too
much employed with hopes and fears of
its own to suffer me to remark him
attentively; but I had noticed that he had
been to the full as abstracted as I. But his
abstraction was of a gloomy order. His
dark eyes, his contracted brow, his set
lips, proclaimed the sullenness of his
thoughts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>I attributed his manner to my neglect
of him, and to his resentment at being
invited to a position which had been despoiled
of its duties. I must confess my
love may have impaired my politeness. I
was no longer the attentive host, solicitous
of his comfort, and on the <i>qui vive</i> to
remove any unpleasant thoughts which his
position would inspire, and which his language,
indeed, would sometimes hint. But
I could easily excuse my neglect, if neglect
it were. It was not to be supposed that
I could regard him altogether in the light
of a guest. Or granting that I chose to do
so, his long stay in my house would have
justified a mitigation of the severe politeness
which it would have been proper to extend
to a man whose sojourn was brief.
"Surely," I remember thinking, "under
the circumstances, he should have sense
enough at this time of day not to expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
from me the anxious attention which I
readily practised at the beginning of our
acquaintance. I have fulfilled conditions
which he could not have anticipated. I
have suffered him to share my home as
though he were a joint proprietor; and I
have tacitly conceded every privilege which
I could with justice to myself yield to him.
I cannot consider him ill-used because I
choose to absent myself in the company
of Mrs. Fraser, in preference to spending
my time with him. He no doubt frets and
fumes at my love as indiscreet&mdash;as menacing
his situation, and as illustrative of weakness
in a nature that had at the onset promised
a vigorous adherence to its original schemes.
But surely," I thought, "it will be time
enough for him to manifest anger when he
shall have been told that I have abandoned
my ambitious resolutions and no longer
require his counsels."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>On reaching home after that walk I have
told you of with Mrs. Fraser, I found
Martelli seated on the lawn. I joined him.
He rose at my approach. His politeness
was punctilious in proportion to his temper.</p>

<p>"Pray keep your seat," said I. "How
have you been passing the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"In reading," he answered with a shrug.</p>

<p>"You say that reproachfully. You think
I should be reading too?"</p>

<p>"Are you not master of your own actions,
Sir?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. I shall resume my reading
by-and-by."</p>

<p>"I hope so, for your own sake. You are
abandoning a fine future."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that? My future is
still mine. I have not abandoned it. I
have still my schemes and my hopes. I
shall try to realise them."</p>

<p>"You will never realise them, Sir, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
allow your mind to be diverted by the
first small attraction that happens to
rise.</p>

<p>"Small attraction! But I can forgive
you. You are a scholar, a student, a recluse&mdash;what
should you know of love?"</p>

<p>His eyes shone.</p>

<p>"Nothing! nothing! I am ignorant of
the passion," he exclaimed, flourishing his
hand.</p>

<p>"Yet I should have taken you to be too
wise a man to have neglected cultivating
your sympathies in the direction where the
most provocation lies. Love is so human
a passion, its consequences are so manifold,
its influences so remarkable, that were you
anything of a philosopher you would have
made it a study. How can you hope to
understand men, when you are ignorant of
the great master-passion of humanity?"</p>

<p>"How do you know I am so ignorant as
you think me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>"I judge so by the sneers you are disposed
to level at love, and by the light contemptuous
manner with which you treat
it."</p>

<p>"May not that prove that I know too
much?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how. Cynicism is of superficial
growth. Deep knowledge makes one
grave and compassionate. The painter knew
life who gave a smirk to the fool and sadness
to the sage."</p>

<p>"But it is to be expected of a man who
has sounded this passion to its bottom that
he should ridicule the belief in its depth,
when he knows it to be shallow."</p>

<p>"Give me leave to push your metaphor.
If you speak of yourself, you probably got
among the shoals, and inferred from your
soundings that the deep was everywhere
shallow."</p>

<p>He gave one of his shrugs and sat silent.
I took out my cigar-case and held it open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to him. He declined with a wave of his
hand. I glanced at his face; it was hard
and angry.</p>

<p>"Martelli," said I, "you are too sensitive.
What has vexed you?"</p>

<p>"How am I sensitive, Sir?" he asked,
growing a shade pale.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you <i>how</i> you are sensitive,"
I replied, stirred a little by the suppressed
irritation of his voice; "but I think I can
guess the cause of your vexation."</p>

<p>"Pray tell me, Sir."</p>

<p>"You think I am neglecting you for Mrs.
Fraser?"</p>

<p>He gave a fierce nod.</p>

<p>"And you are disposed to resent my
placing you in so anomalous a position as
that which you now occupy?"</p>

<p>"Sir, never mind that. I admit you have
disappointed me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot see how."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>"How should you see? You are blinded
by love."</p>

<p>"Signor Martelli, I must beg you to calm
yourself. I cannot suffer such language as
this."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, you provoke me!" he exclaimed,
gesticulating and growing yet paler.
"You raise expectations to disappoint them.
When I came here, I secretly pledged myself
to carry you through any schemes you had
a mind to indulge. All my diligence, my
time, my knowledge, my patience, I meant
to give to you. I liked you, Sir. Your
manners pleased me. It was charming to
attend one so acute and so humble&mdash;so quick
to perceive and so eager to be taught.
And I too had my ambitions! They are
gone."</p>

<p>"They are not gone, Martelli," I said,
softened.</p>

<p>"They are, Sir!" he cried, clenching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
both fists. "It is a blow. I am a poor
man. Had you let me do for you what I
could have done, you would have requited
me. Of that I am sure. Yes, Sir; I am
not so ignorant of human nature as not to
tell generosity when I see it; and yours is a
generous mind. It made me this promise:
it said, 'Martelli, serve me well, advance
my schemes, impart the knowledge and the
power your experience and learning can inspire,
and when I have achieved the ends I
covet I will reward you.' That is what you
told me, Sir."</p>

<p>"But what did you expect?"</p>

<p>"As much as it was in your power to
confer. You would not have forgotten the
man who gave you help when you needed it.
You might have made me your secretary&mdash;your
agent&mdash;your amanuensis. You would
have invented some post for me to fill&mdash;you
would, at least, have rescued me from a life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of drudgery. But now, I am forced back
again upon my pitiful calling&mdash;teaching at
schools, soliciting pupils, and starving as a
teacher!"</p>

<p>"I see no necessity. Have I dismissed
you?"</p>

<p>"I dismiss myself!" he cried, standing up
and striking his chest with his fist.</p>

<p>I was impressed by his vehemence; at
once pained and made curious by his manner.</p>

<p>"At all events," I said, "if you go, you
go of your own accord."</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>"But at the same time you will allow me
to say that I think you foolish for exhibiting
so much impatience."</p>

<p>"Impatience!" he exclaimed, with a sharp
laugh. "Oh, no! I am not impatient.
But, Sir, it is not pleasant to be given to
drink of a wine that is dashed from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
lips after you have tasted enough to like
its sweetness."</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow, nobody <i>has</i>
dashed the wine away, that I can see."</p>

<p>"You have! you have!" he cried, with
a grin of anger.</p>

<p>"I? You are dreaming."</p>

<p>"<i>Sacramento!</i> don't tell me I dream!"</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell you something
worse," said I, getting up; "if you don't
moderate your temper, I shall have to tell
you that you are mad."</p>

<p>"That it should come to this!" he muttered,
looking up, as though he apostrophised
the air.</p>

<p>"You speak English fluently," said I;
"let me entreat you to express yourself intelligibly
that I may understand your grievance."</p>

<p>He left me; walked to the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
lawn, returned, approached close to me, and
said,</p>

<p>"It is your intention, Sir, to marry, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"When, Sir, do you marry?"</p>

<p>"I shall probably make the lady an offer
to-morrow," I answered, compressing my
lips to disguise a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah!" He nodded fiercely, walked once
more to the edge of the lawn, and returned.
"You are serious, Sir? You really mean
to marry?"</p>

<p>I could not help laughing out, as I answered,
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, pay me what you owe me,
and let me go."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to leave at once?"</p>

<p>"At once!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Very well; come with me to the library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
I will reckon what I am in your debt and
pay you."</p>

<p>He followed me into the house. I seated
myself at the writing-table. But hardly
believing it possible he could be in earnest,
or wishing at least to make one more effort
to conciliate him, I said,</p>

<p>"Will you not defer this matter until to-morrow?
Take to-night to think over your
resolution. This kind of separation is very
ungracious and unpleasant. I really do not
wish you to go. I have told you before I
like your company, and have found you
most valuable. I repeat it now."</p>

<p>"But you are going to marry?"</p>

<p>"What of that? After my marriage we
will continue our reading."</p>

<p>"But you are going to marry?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Good heaven! Do you think Mrs.
Fraser an ogress? Do you think she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
eat you? When you know her you will
like her." He shook his head furiously,
and violently waved his hand before his
face.</p>

<p>"Pay me, Sir, pay me, and let me go!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Disgusted by his irritable perversity, I
drew out my cheque-book.</p>

<p>"Can you not pay me in gold?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you prefer it. But first
let me see what I owe you."</p>

<p>I took a slip of paper and made my
calculations; then went to an iron safe,
drew out a cash-box and gave him the
money.</p>

<p>"There," said I, "is the discharge of
your proper claims. But I owe you something
for the interest you have taken in me
and the hearty industry you have employed
on my behalf. This will perhaps make my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
gratitude more significant than were I to
express it in words only."</p>

<p>And I handed a bank note for twenty
pounds.</p>

<p>He took, folded, and put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, Sir," he said,
with a low bow, "but in taking it, it
is 'my poverty, but not my will, consents.'"</p>

<p>"Shall my servant carry your portmanteau?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no; it is not heavy. I can
carry it myself."</p>

<p>"The phaeton is at your service, if you
wish to drive to Cornpool."</p>

<p>"I will walk, Sir."</p>

<p>I held out my hand, but pretending not
to notice the action he gave me another
low bow and left the room. In less
than twenty minutes I saw him walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
portmanteau in hand, down the front
garden.</p>

<p>Thus ended my connection with this
singular little man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>Had I had nothing else to do but to read
and muse I should have greatly missed Martelli.
As it was, I felt his absence on the
evening that followed his departure. I
missed his dark face, his glowing eye, his
rapid speech, his tart questions. His arm-chair
looked very empty without him. My
supper too was somewhat tasteless, wanting
the sharp condiment of his tongue and
gestures. But how should I feel his absence
very sensibly with Mrs. Fraser to comfort
me? I only wonder I felt it at all. Our
parting had not been calculated to sharpen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
regret. I had no notion he was such a
passionate man. There was no doubt he
had been insulting. But what in the world
could have provoked such an outbreak?
He would have had me believe it was my
resolution to marry Mrs. Fraser that angered
him. But what was Mrs. Fraser to him?
Was he a monomaniac&mdash;mad on the subject
of women? We know that there are people
born with antipathies which nothing can
shake. Lady Heneage would faint at the
sight of a rose; the Marquis de la Rochejacquelin
would turn white with fear before
a squirrel; and I have read in some author
of a man whose antipathy to old women
was such, that once when his friends, by
way of joke, introduced an elderly female
into his presence, he fell in a fit and died.
I do not say that I quite believed this to
be Martelli's disease: but I was strongly
disposed to think that he had some eccentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
aversion to living in a house where there
was a mistress.</p>

<p>I did not pass a quiet night. I had resolved
to propose next day to my beautiful
neighbour, and my resolution rather agitated
me. A man may do in a moment of impulse
what he would fear to attempt in cold
blood. I was rather sorry I had not proposed
that afternoon. I had been surrounded
by conditions highly favourable to
a declaration. It would have been over now,
and I should have been able to sleep the
sleep of the accepted.</p>

<p>I had told her I would call in the morning.
At another time she might have asked
me in her odd sweet way "Why?" but her
silence was auspicious. She had lowered her
beautiful eyes, and the conscious curve of
her mouth gave me reason to believe she had
guessed my mission.</p>

<p>So at about eleven o'clock, when the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
stood high and the land lay hot and still
beneath its fiery gaze, I took my hat and
stepped over to Elmore Cottage. There
was no need of ceremony now to gain admittance.
The girl knew I was a privileged
visitor and admitted me with a smile.</p>

<p>I entered the little drawing-room. It was
empty. The blinds were half drawn, and
the window stood wide open. Signs of her
recent presence were visible in the garden
hat upon the sofa, in some drawing materials
on the table, above all, in the soft peculiar
perfume which I associated with her. She
was such a strange woman that I thought
she might have hidden on hearing my
knock; and I looked behind the sofa, and
the door, and in the corner protected by the
piano, for her. Then I drew to the table
to see what she was drawing. It was a
man's head, unfinished though complete
enough to offer a good likeness. The hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
was dark, the nose straight, the mouth firm,
the eye sufficiently large. The slight line of
whisker was not shaded. This sketch dissipated
all my nervousness. I looked up
with a smile, and met her eyes peering at
me from the door.</p>

<p>"If I had known it was you I should
have hid that," said she, coming forward in
a somewhat defiant manner, but with a
delicate pink on her cheek.</p>

<p>"Did you not want me to see it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why? It is charmingly done&mdash;the very
image of me."</p>

<p>She came round to where I stood.</p>

<p>"Go and stand opposite," she said, "and
then I shall be able to tell."</p>

<p>I did as she bade me.</p>

<p>"Hold your face in profile."</p>

<p>I looked at the wall. She was silent for
some moments.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes. It is not bad. My memory must
be good."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fraser," said I, "what made you
take my face for a subject?"</p>

<p>"Are you annoyed?"</p>

<p>"No; and you don't think me annoyed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I fancied you would think I had
not flattered you enough."</p>

<p>"But what made you take my face?"</p>

<p>"Because it suited me."</p>

<p>I placed a chair for her and seated myself
at her side.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fraser, I know your Christian
name&mdash;it is Geraldine. May I call you
Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I read it at the corner of those drawings
there."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"May I call you Geraldine?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"If you like. Do you think it a pretty
name?"</p>

<p>"A sweet name. Now, Geraldine, will
you tell me what made you take my face
for a sketch?"</p>

<p>The utterance of her name pleased her.
She looked up at me with lighted eyes.</p>

<p>"Have I not told you?"</p>

<p>"No. Your answer was evasive. I want
the truth."</p>

<p>"I wished to see if I could hit off its
expression with my pencil."</p>

<p>"And you have drawn a good likeness.
But I miss one thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked, getting up
and looking at the drawing.</p>

<p>"Look at those eyes," I answered, bending
over her and pointing.</p>

<p>"Well; they are bold&mdash;do you mean
they are not large enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are large enough. But they
do not tell the truth."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"What should they tell?"</p>

<p>"My love, Geraldine."</p>

<p>She did not answer. I passed my arm
round her waist.</p>

<p>"Do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to my face. I searched
them; they were calm, and pensive and
soft, but radiant too, with a light that was
new to them.</p>

<p>"I understand," she whispered.</p>

<p>I led her to a chair and knelt by her that
I might see her face, holding her hand in
both mine.</p>

<p>"Geraldine, you knew that I loved you?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not know it."</p>

<p>"But you suspected it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I could not help suspecting it."</p>

<p>"And do you love me, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well enough to be my wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>I kissed her forehead. "How am I to
thank you for your love?"</p>

<p>"By always, always, loving me."</p>

<p>"I will always love you, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will," she answered
fondly, smoothing my cheek; "and your
name is Arthur. May I call you Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Of course you may."</p>

<p>"Arthur," she said, looking earnestly
into my eyes, "what makes you want me to
be your wife?"</p>

<p>"My love."</p>

<p>"And what makes you love me?"</p>

<p>"Your sweetness&mdash;your waywardness&mdash;and
all the little points and lights, the
colour and shadow, which make up your
character and your beauty."</p>

<p>"But would you like my character if I
were not pretty?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I should."</p>

<p>"You would think me rude. My face is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
like charity to my character&mdash;it hides my
multitude of sins."</p>

<p>"Your face is like music to poetry&mdash;it
turns your character to song."</p>

<p>"Arthur, you may compliment me now
if you like; I shall love to hear your
praise."</p>

<p>"Dearest," I exclaimed, rising, "how
proud and happy your love makes me feel!
Finding you here in this solitude and taking
you from it, makes me resemble one of
those knights of old who rescued beautiful
damsels from the guardianship of the
horrible dragons which then flourished.
Your dragon is more matter-of-fact than
the scaly brutes the poets sing of; but let
me tell you it is quite as formidable. <i>Ennui</i>
is its name."</p>

<p>"Come into the garden," she exclaimed,
springing up; "I prefer talking in the sunshine."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>"Come into my garden," I answered;
"there are trees there and we shall like the
cool shade." And she tied on her hat before
the looking-glass, regarding me with her
black eyes, though she seemed to regard
herself. I said, "Would you like to live at
Elmore Court when we are married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she answered, turning quickly
round, "I would not choose to live anywhere
else."</p>

<p>"But will you not find it dull?"</p>

<p>"Not with you," she replied.</p>

<p>I kissed her hand. "At all events," I
said, "we can live there until the term I
have taken it for is expired."</p>

<p>"We will live there always," she exclaimed
earnestly. "But come into the
garden. You can tell how much I care for
the world by living here," she continued, as
we left the house; "indeed I never wish to
see the world again. I will make you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>promise
always to live at Elmore Court, for
there we shall be alone. I shall want you all
to myself, Arthur. Indeed you will find
me jealous, dear&mdash;would you like me to be
jealous?"</p>

<p>"It is the most genuine test of love.
You will find me jealous too."</p>

<p>"Shall I?" she cried, clapping her hands.
"And it will be very proper that you
should. But I doubt if you'll have occasion."</p>

<p>We passed through the gate and entered
the grounds of Elmore Court.</p>

<p>"How could you think I should be dull
here?" she asked, prettily folding her hands,
whilst she paused to look at the building
and the brilliant <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> of the garden.
"All day long I should be busy with my
flowers, and in the evening you should read
to me, and teach me all you know, that I
may become as wise as you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>"I will show you over the house presently,
Geraldine. Meanwhile let us seat ourselves
under those trees. Dearest," I said, taking
her hand, "I have been so long looking
forward to this time, when I may call you
and think of you as my own, that now it is
come I cannot believe it here."</p>

<p>"You have not had to wait very long.
Did you expect to win me so easily?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I felt you would become
my wife."</p>

<p>"But I was not destined for you, or I
should have married you first. Is it here
we are to sit?"</p>

<p>"We are in the shade here."</p>

<p>She passed her hand through my arm and
pressed her shoulder against mine.</p>

<p>"Do you feel happy, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly happy."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to ask me any questions
about my past, dearest?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>"No. If there is anything I should
know you will tell me."</p>

<p>She sighed and pressed her cheek against
my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Arthur," she whispered, "my marriage
was not a happy one."</p>

<p>"I should have thought that, Geraldine,
by your eyes."</p>

<p>"Are they so very mournful?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. But mournful does not so
well define their expression as pensive.
Your heart is sometimes troubled."</p>

<p>"With the past," she rejoined quickly
and eagerly. "My husband did not love
me. He left me. When I became a widow
I resolved to bury my sorrow and my life in
some quiet obscure corner like Cliffegate.
I have a little income, Arthur&mdash;why do
you not ask me about it? Other men
would."</p>

<p>"I hope you will not find me altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
like other men; though I hope I am no
Pharisee."</p>

<p>"I have two hundred a year. It was left
me by grandmamma. Her solicitor sends
me fifty pounds every quarter. You may
have it all, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear; and in return you shall
have two thousand a year to spend with
me."</p>

<p>"Is that your fortune?" she asked, opening
her eyes.</p>

<p>I nodded, with a smile.</p>

<p>"How rich you are! But it is nice to
have plenty of money, and I shan't love
you the less for having it. No; many
women would pretend that they would
much rather have found you poor, that they
might feel sure you knew you were loved
only for yourself. Now I am glad you are
rich; not because I care for your money,
but because I know that such a fortune as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
yours must have enabled you to see life, and
that your choice of me comes after an experience
of the world. It will be a matured
choice, so that I shall not be likely to lose
you."</p>

<p>"Geraldine, you talk the language of
wisdom, as the Turks say. I <i>have</i> seen life,
and can promise you that my love is not the
caprice of a greenhorn."</p>

<p>"Now you shall show me over your
house," she said, jumping up.</p>

<p>I conducted her in by the balcony, and
when we were in the library I said, "This is
the room in which I first saw you."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I fell asleep, and in that sleep I
saw your face."</p>

<p>"Were you frightened, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"It was only a dream. But I was
frightened when I saw you afterwards."</p>

<p>"What a quantity of books you have!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
she exclaimed, standing on tiptoe to read
the backs of the volumes on the upper
shelves. "Have you read them all?"</p>

<p>"I wish I had. I should be a wiser
man."</p>

<p>"Too wise to marry me, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"The wisdom that would prohibit that
would be very closely allied to insanity. I
have had little reason during my life to flatter
myself on my judgment; but I think I may
boast of my wisdom now."</p>

<p>"This room is very pretty, and those
grounds look lovely from the window; yet
you must have felt dull here."</p>

<p>"I confess I did&mdash;in spite of the entertainment
provided for me by a sharp sinister
little foreigner named Martelli, whom I
hired to keep me company&mdash;a little man&mdash;humorous,
passionate, and I daresay vengeful."</p>

<p>"I dislike foreigners," she said, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
shudder. "Why did you not employ an
Englishman?"</p>

<p>"The fact was, I wished to learn Italian."</p>

<p>"Was he an Italian?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you like Italians?"</p>

<p>"I hate them!" she exclaimed, her face
flushing with sudden passion while her eyes
flashed irefully.</p>

<p>"Then it was fortunate he resolved to
leave me. You and he would hardly have
got on. Perhaps," I said, laughing, "his
subtle sagacity pierced the marble of your
face when he saw you, and discerned your
aversion to his compatriots."</p>

<p>"I thought you were alone?"</p>

<p>"On the first night I was. On the
second night I hadn't positively spirit enough
to risk a second encounter. But, dearest, I
have come to show you over the house."</p>

<p>"I am ready," she exclaimed, her face
and manner changing in one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
abrupt alternations that made so curious a
feature of her character.</p>

<p>"But first," said I, touching the bell,
"there is an imposing ceremony to be gone
through. I must introduce you to Mrs.
Williams, my housekeeper; a very worthy
woman, whom you will find a most useful
minister to help you in the government of
this little kingdom."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Williams entered I said,
"This is my housekeeper, Geraldine;" and
then to the other, "Mrs. Williams, this
lady, I hope, will shortly come here to take
possession of Elmore Court as its mistress.
I wished her to become acquainted with you."</p>

<p>She curtseyed without any expression of
surprise. Geraldine took her hand.</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall like you, Mrs.
Williams. The appearance of this house,
so far as I have seen, tells me how valuable
you will be to me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am grateful for your kind opinion,
ma'am," said Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p>"Are you not surprised to hear of Mr.
Thornburn's resolution to marry me?" asked
Geraldine, in her pretty downright way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it would happen so soon,"
she replied; "but I guessed it would end in
his marrying you, ma'am."</p>

<p>"There, Geraldine," I said, "you see
Mrs. Williams knows how I have thought
of you."</p>

<p>"Did I want Mrs. Williams to tell me?"</p>

<p>"At all events it is well to have a
witness."</p>

<p>She slipped her soft little hand into mine
as we left the room; and so, conducted by
Mrs. Williams, we passed from one room
to another. My darling's delight was
genuine. Her child-like pleasure at all she
saw was delicious to me to watch. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
incessant in her praises of Mrs. Williams'
taste and orderliness; and to do that good
woman justice, she deserved all the admiration
she received. She listened complacently
to Geraldine's prattle; and when she found
that she was no longer required, slipped
quietly away.</p>

<p>We stood at the drawing-room window.
She had thrown aside her hat, and the sunlight
made gold of her beautiful hair.</p>

<p>"Do you like Elmore Court?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is a sweet home."</p>

<p>"And do you think you will be happy
here?"</p>

<p>"Cannot you guess? I feel perfectly
happy now, Arthur; and that implies great
trust in you&mdash;if I did not think you loved
me with all your strength I could not be
happy. Yet there was a time when I
thought I could never be happy again&mdash;never
happy again," she repeated, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
little sigh. "It was winter with me then,
but it is summer now. It is sweet to be
loved. There are women who say they
could live without love; but I do not believe
them. Women were born to be
loved."</p>

<p>"Some women were," I answered, toying
with her hand.</p>

<p>"I have been very lonely, Arthur. Sometimes
I thought I should go mad. It is bad
for the mind to feed upon itself. The
longer its abstinence the more painful grows
its craving; and to satisfy itself at last, it
invents strange fancies and dreadful thoughts&mdash;and
that is how people become crazy.
Your face and voice are a new life to me.
I feel that I am not dead now. But there
have been times when I thought myself a
ghost. Did you ever have that feeling?
It always brought a pain here;" she touched
her forehead. "See there!" she suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
exclaimed, "what a beautiful butterfly! If
I were a little girl I should love to chase it.
But I would not now," she added, shaking
her head; "those who have suffered much
are always merciful."</p>

<p>"Now, Geraldine, I want to speak to
you of our marriage."</p>

<p>"Yes." She looked up.</p>

<p>"Are you not a Roman Catholic?"</p>

<p>"I am. Do you like Roman Catholics?"</p>

<p>"Quite as well as Protestants, though I
am a stanch Protestant."</p>

<p>"After all we are agreed upon the chief
points of religion?"</p>

<p>"Very nearly. Toleration is the most
material point in which we differ. But
Christianity is the religion of love; and love
is large and can find room for many sects.
But to revert to our wedding&mdash;we shall have
to be married in two churches."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is there a Roman Catholic church
here?"</p>

<p>"No. But there is one at Cornpool. I
know Father John; he is my confessor."</p>

<p>"How often do you confess?"</p>

<p>"I do not like to say," she replied,
timidly; "it is not often enough."</p>

<p>"Once a year?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, no! Once a month."</p>

<p>"So often?"</p>

<p>"So often! I should confess by right once
a week. Would you mind me going to
Father John?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Let me say this concession was only an
act of policy. I determined to try to convert
her.</p>

<p>"The want of a church," she continued,
"was a great drawback to Cliffegate. But
I knew there was one at Cornpool. Yet the
little cottage suited me so well, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
place was so secluded, I could not resist
taking it."</p>

<p>"Then, Geraldine, we shall have to be
married at Cornpool. And now, dearest,
when?"</p>

<p>"When you wish, Arthur."</p>

<p>"I want to possess you, dearest. This
life is so full of uncertainty that, now you
have accepted me, I should not be happy
until we are married. Will the end of the
month be too soon?"</p>

<p>"Impatient Arthur!" she said, pressing
my hand to her cheek.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>We were married at the end of the
month, and when I brought my beautiful
bride back to Elmore Court, I thought myself
the happiest man in the world. I had
reason indeed to think so; for I had
marked in Geraldine a depth and earnestness
of passion which I felt time would deepen
and make still more earnest. And yet what
was there about her that forced me into
light musings, of which I was hardly conscious
of the tenor? Of course, I deemed
her love genuine, and I knew afterwards
that it was genuine. Yet there was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
it a suggestion of oddness, a hint of some
sombre presence, which my instincts surely
felt, if my heart did not at first recognise.</p>

<p>But her beauty was of the radiant type
that sheds a universal lustre on the character.
It transfigured her in my eyes. It threw a
veil of light over her nature, and hid from
my sight those features which a lesser grace
must have discovered. My love was apt to
give names of its own to the qualities it
detected. To me, there seemed no violation
of reason in calling her artless, wayward,
childlike. I found her capricious conversation
fascinating, not perplexing. Her habit
of breaking off in her grave speech to chase
some irrelevant and simple fancy charmed
me. Her composite character suggested the
two extremes of womanly sense and childlike
innocence, and her beauty filled with light
the void that divided them. So that I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
no notice of the want of those connecting
links, those pauses and gradations of mind,
which in reality are as needful to the intellectual
character as the middle keys of an
instrument are essential to its capacity for
producing harmony.</p>

<p>I had proposed that we should spend our
honeymoon abroad; but she would not
listen to our leaving Elmore Court. She
said it was now in the fulness of its beauty,
and where should we find abroad so lovely
and quiet an abode? "Did I not tell you,
naughty boy, that I would not leave this
house?" she had said. "It is the very perfection
of a home, in my eyes. We know
no one. We can have all the long days to
ourselves. I can work in the garden without
minding my dress. I should hate to
have to keep myself tidy to receive callers&mdash;stupid
people, who would come to envy
and go away to tell stories. Look at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
hair now&mdash;if I were anywhere else I should
have to keep it dressed."</p>

<p>And she pointed at her reflection in the
glass, which showed her yellow hair negligently
looped behind with a piece of blue
ribbon, with stray curls sunning over her
white forehead, and streaming down her
back.</p>

<p>She seemed, and she was, I am sure, perfectly
happy. The gardeners took to her
at once; and I would often see one or the
other of them following her about to listen
to her directions, touching his cap so often
as he received her wishes; and yet, spite of
his respectful manner, hinting by his behaviour
that he thought her rather more of
a child than a woman.</p>

<p>She had wanted to bring her own maid
Lucy along with her, but the two servants
and Mrs. Williams were enough for our
wants. So Lucy returned to the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
with the promise of filling the next vacancy
in Elmore Court.</p>

<p>I purchased a phaeton and a smart little
mare, and would drive Geraldine long excursions
into the country. The memory of
those days is very fresh. She seems to be
at my side while I write, her large luminous
eyes fixed on my face, her small white hand
on my neck, interrupting me with the
musical lilt of her voice to tell me of a
bright-plumed bird that is drinking at the
fountain.</p>

<p>You do not ask me what had become of
the fine resolutions that had brought me to
Cliffegate. You know, for you have doubtless
experienced, that love is too absorbing a
business to admit of any other occupation.
The living freshness of my wife's society
made my library a kind of mausoleum; and
if I preferred basking in the luxury of her
beauty to handling the dusty skeletons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
lined the shelves, you will not be surprised.
At the time of forming my resolutions I
had never contemplated marrying; and now
that I <i>had</i> married, my wife, for the time
being at all events, fully satisfied the craving
for occupation, for something to live for,
which I had hoped ambition might have
appeased. Yet I did not despair of waking
one morning with a strong impulse to study.
The fact of my life being no longer companionless
would disarm the fears of ambition;
and I felt that, should I fail in the
attempt to distinguish myself hereafter, disappointment
would be qualified, if indeed
not obviated, by the knowledge that I had
always by my side some one to love and
who loved me, and whose happiness it
would be a joyous occupation to minister
to.</p>

<p>Her dislike of society had at first surprised
me; but it made me love her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
more. It argued, I thought, her ignorance
of her fascination; for I could not doubt,
had she known her powers of delighting,
that she would never have buried them in
so dead a retreat as Cliffegate. She was
twenty-seven, a period of a woman's life
when her love of pleasure and admiration
is strong; though, it must be owned, that
this love very often strengthens in proportion
as time makes its gratification more
difficult. Marrying her as I had, without
a deep knowledge of her character, it would
not have surprised me had she expressed a
desire to change her solitude for a life of
pleasure. The dull time she had passed
would certainly have justified the wish. Her
eagerness therefore to remain hidden from
the world pleased me. It illustrated a
nature pure and unsophisticated; a heart
innocent and sincere. And it made me
happy to believe I could always think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
her as my own, without having the calmness
of my devotion sullied by those breezes of
jealousy which society sometimes brings with
it, and which one's particular friends generally
take care shall increase to gales.</p>

<p>We passed our time almost wholly together.
She did not like that I should ever
be from her side. She would call me from
a book or a letter, to come and watch her
watering some favourite plants, or any other
work she might be at. And when such an
excuse would be wanting, she would sit by
me, take my hand, and so remain quiet,
rubbing her cheek against my shoulder, and
by her action and eloquent breathing
suggesting the grace and purring of a
kitten.</p>

<p>It was strange that I should have inspired
such a love. This narrative has, I fear,
given you but an imperfect conception of my
character; yet you may infer enough from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the crude sketch to make you wonder that
any one so commonplace as I, should have
given such life and movement to the deepest
and most latent instincts of this beautiful
creature's nature.</p>

<p>She had well said she was born to be
loved. Her sensibilities were singularly
acute; her nature warm and sudden; her
sympathies too powerful; for they agitated
her with more joy and grief than the occasion
that bred the emotion justified. Her spirit,
made tameless by solitude, desired the corrective
of love; her fancies needed sobering;
her longings wanted interpreting; her whole
nature demanded the warmth of imparted
passion to give life to slumbering powers,
nourishment to sickly instincts, sap and
vigour to the drooping qualities which had
developed in loneliness and blossomed in
sorrow.</p>

<p>Such were the speculations on her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>character
I <i>then</i> indulged in; and from the
standpoint I occupied they were just. But
when some time had passed, and I got to
penetrate her character more deeply, the
undefinable feeling about her I have before
spoken of became more definite.</p>

<p>I remember well the pain and horror that
accompanied the suspicion when it first
flashed upon me. I endeavoured to reason
the conjecture away; but the very arguments
I brought to bear against it turned traitor
and marshalled themselves on the other side.
I reviewed her conduct; I recalled her
actions, her language, her moods. They
increased my apprehension.</p>

<p>Now that love no longer consented to
blind me, now that I suffered myself to be
possessed with suspicion, I knew that the
truest confirmation of my fear was to be
sought and found in her eyes. The light
that sometimes leaped from their depths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the vacant dullness that sometimes made
them lustreless, were not always the sparkle
or the shadow of the mood then on
her.</p>

<p>I was alone when I first fell into this train
of thinking. She had not left me long;
and I heard her singing in the drawing-room
as she sought in her portfolio for a sketch
which she announced her intention to finish.
I threw down the book I held and went to
the library. My mood was a strange one:
a curiosity and a despair&mdash;a feverish wish to
know the truth, with a terror of that truth.
I strode to and fro, dreading that my face
(which I could never force to mask my
feelings) would provoke her questioning,
and striving to master the miserable doubts
that had seized me. But she soon missed
me and came to the library, peeping in as
was her wont, and then, bounding forward
with a movement graceful as a child's.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>"You shall not read," said she, taking
my hand and pulling me to the door. "I
want you to watch me finish my drawing of
our home."</p>

<p>"Leave me a little, Geraldine; I will be
with you soon."</p>

<p>"Why not now?" she asked, pouting
her under lip. And then, coming in front
of me, she looked right up in my face.</p>

<p>"Arthur," she whispered, "you look now
as you look when you are asleep."</p>

<p>"What kind of look is that, Geraldine?"
I said, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>"Come with me and I will tell you."</p>

<p>When we were in the parlour she took
a penknife and began to sharpen a pencil.
She frowned over her task and then laughed,
but so quietly that the sound died in a
breath.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me how I look in my sleep."</p>

<p>She laid knife and pencil on the table, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
knelt before me, resting her hands on my
knees.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know I watched you in
your sleep, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Not by moonlight-though the moon
shines bright sometimes; but never bright
enough for me to see you. But when
you are sleeping soundly I steal out of bed,
and light the candle and watch you. But
first I listen to your breathing. If it is
calm then I watch; but if it is disturbed I
go to sleep. Shall I tell you why?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Because I never know whether you are
dreaming of me or not. If you breathe
short and troubled, the expression of your
face might give me pain&mdash;it would be
troubled, too; and if I were to think at
such a time that you were dreaming of me
it would make me wretched." She sighed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"And when I breathe calmly?"</p>

<p>"Then I love to look at you; for you
may be dreaming of me. I watch you much
longer than you can tell; but I do not look
at you too long at a time for fear my eyes
should awaken you."</p>

<p>"But what makes you do this?"</p>

<p>"Do I not tell you? Besides," and she
averted her face and gave me a sweet shy
look, "my watching might make you dream
of me."</p>

<p>"But could not I dream of you as well
when you are by my side?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No. You can
make people dream of you by looking at
them in their sleep."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Geraldine," I exclaimed, a
little warmly; "this is some crazy old
woman's belief: you must not think such
things."</p>

<p>I saw her upturned eyes slowly cloud with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
tears. Her beauty, too, suddenly took the
same intensely plaintive and piteous expression
I had marked in her when I had seen
her walking in her sleep.</p>

<p>"You are angry with me, Arthur."</p>

<p>"No, dearest," I answered, kissing the
tears from her eyes, "I am not angry with
you. I only think you should not indulge
such foolish fancies."</p>

<p>She smiled. It was like an April sunbeam
shining after a shower. Springing
from her knees, "Now for my drawing!"
she exclaimed. She drew a chair to the
table and went to work at once.</p>

<p>Some time after this, in going upstairs I
met Mrs. Williams. She stepped aside to
let me pass, but I paused on the landing.
I had an idea that she was a much shrewder
woman than her calm, pleasant, but not
highly intelligent countenance would have
suggested. I called her to the window on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the landing and pointed to the front garden.
Geraldine stood at the fountain making a
cup of her hands to receive one of the silver
threads of water which fell into the brimming
basin.</p>

<p>"She seems as happy as a child here, does
she not?" I said.</p>

<p>"She is like a child, Sir; innocent and
gay as any little girl of five."</p>

<p>"And yet she is very womanly too; and
it is this combination of gravity and simplicity
that makes her so fascinating. Do
you often talk with her, Mrs. Williams?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, Sir."</p>

<p>"What do you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of different things."</p>

<p>"I dare say she puzzles your plain understanding?"
I said, with a laugh, whose
artificiality made it worse than my gravity.
"She has a way of breaking off in her
speech, of jumping from one idea to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
another, that must make her sometimes
difficult for you to understand, eh?"</p>

<p>She glanced at me and quickly averted
her eyes to the garden.</p>

<p>"Mistress," she said, "doesn't always talk
quite collectedly."</p>

<p>"You have hit it exactly. She is sometimes
a little incoherent."</p>

<p>"She is, Sir; but that comes, I am sure,
from too much good spirits. She's as bright
and brisk as a bird which the eye can't
always follow."</p>

<p>"Do you really think this way of hers
comes from her good spirits?"</p>

<p>"I beg you'll excuse me, Sir," she remarked,
folding her hands, "but I should
like to know what you think."</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Williams, I question you.
Pray be perfectly frank with me. You
must see I have a motive in asking you
these questions. I have faith in your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>judgment,
and I am anxious to hear your
opinion of Mrs. Thorburn."</p>

<p>Her fingers worked nervously, and something
like an expression of distress entered
her face. She remained silent. I
looked through the window; Geraldine was
gone.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Williams, I am going to ask you
a question. The fact of my asking it will
convince you of the high opinion I have
of your character and how much I appreciate
your conduct since you have been in
my service. It will imply also the confidence
I possess in your truth and secrecy&mdash;in
your truth to give me an honest downright
answer, and in your secrecy to conceal
whatever discovery you may make. Do
you think my wife sane?"</p>

<p>The answer came reluctantly: "No, Sir."</p>

<p>"What makes you doubt her sanity?"</p>

<p>"Her manners, Sir, and her behaviour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and sometimes a look she has in her eyes;
but her conversation, principally."</p>

<p>"Have you had any experience of mad
people?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir. Father once took charge of
a niece of his that was mad."</p>

<p>"What form did her madness take?"</p>

<p>"She was very cunning. Her mind was
full of crazy thoughts; but she seemed to
know that if she spoke them she would be
thought mad. But she couldn't always hide
them. And she was very artful. She would
steal things and hide them so that nobody
could find them. She was taken worse
after she had been with us a year, and we
had to send her to an asylum over at Barnstock,
where she died raving."</p>

<p>"You would be more likely, after such
an experience, to know madness when you
saw it than I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>"And do you seriously and truly think
Mrs. Thorburn mad?"</p>

<p>"You ask me, Sir&mdash;it's painful to say&mdash;but
I would swear there is madness in
her."</p>

<p>"When did you make the discovery?"</p>

<p>"I didn't make it suddenly. I had my
suspicions after she had been in the house
two or three days. But I became sure
when, not long after she had been here,
she came to me and told me she had seen
a shadow in the air of a hand holding a
knife."</p>

<p>"She told you this?" I exclaimed, with a
start.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir. She spoke in a whisper, looking
around her, like one who tells a great
secret. Her eyes were all alight, but her
cheeks were pale. She told me not to tell
you."</p>

<p>"And you kept your promise?" I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
bitterly. "Why did you not tell me?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't the heart, Sir. I saw how you
loved her&mdash;how you loved each other&mdash;and
I couldn't speak. Besides, I thought it
might be some wild notion she had brought
away with her from her home. She led a
dull life, and I guessed all sorts of strange
fancies might have taken her in her loneliness.
And to speak the truth, Sir, though
I feared that her mind was not right, I
thought your company would bring her
back to herself."</p>

<p>"And do you think she has improved?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, Sir."</p>

<p>"What am I to do, Mrs. Williams? how
do you advise me to act?"</p>

<p>Just then I heard my wife singing as she
mounted the stairs, and we broke off our
conversation. I put on a cheerful look;
and when she saw me she came bounding
up, with lighted eyes and outstretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
hands, her face brilliant with a smile. Mrs.
Williams had left the landing before Geraldine
reached me; and for my part, I appeared
in the act of descending. She caught my
hand and kissed it, a frequent action with
her, but she did it with an exquisite grace,
as one would do who had learnt her attitudes
from nature.</p>

<p>She had a little story to tell me; how,
deep in the shadows of the orchard, she had
been watching a green and purple insect
crawl from a hole in a tree to a stone, under
which it vanished; and when she turned
the stone over with a stick a thousand
strange things wriggled away. "It taught me
something! it taught me something!" she
cried.</p>

<p>I asked her what.</p>

<p>"I said to myself," she answered gravely,
"that green and purple insect is a lie, and I
who follow it am the world; for its colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
please me and I can't help pursuing it. And
the stone it has crept under is corruption,
where a thousand other falsehoods, some
pretty and some very ugly, lie hid; and
when I turn it over, I am like a reformer,
who floods corruption with the blaze of
heaven, and all the foul things rush from
the light of truth. Is not that pretty,
Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest; but do you know what
your little fable typifies?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The Reformation. You were Luther,
the stone was Rome, the wriggling insects
the priests."</p>

<p>"No, no! There never was a Reformation;
there was a wicked schism."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let us argue," I said, with
a cheerless laugh.</p>

<p>She had descended the stairs with me, forgetting
the purpose for which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
mounted them. The harshness of my laugh
struck her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, darling."</p>

<p>"You do not look as you used. You
look frightened."</p>

<p>"Of what should I be frightened?"</p>

<p>"You are; your eyes are scared. Now
am I not sharp, to read your face so quickly?
Oh, but I know every line in it! I can
see the slightest shadow pass over it. It
lies quite transparent. It is like the water
in the marble basin. I was watching the
water not long ago. I saw the tiniest bird,
mirrored deep, deep down. Do you know,
Arthur, I sometimes think I could fly? I
feel so light&mdash;so light&mdash;I am sure I should
only have to put out my arms to rise."</p>

<p>"You would become an angel before your
time, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"But I would never fly away from you,
Arthur."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>"I hope not, for I don't know how I
should be able to pursue you."</p>

<p>She laughed. I passed my arm through
hers, and we entered the garden.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>Day after day I watched her closely.
Fear made observation keen. I had fondly
hoped that both Mrs. Williams and I had
been mistaken&mdash;that our commonplace minds
had confounded the brisk and illogical expression
of an agile intellect with madness.
But conviction came at last: I could doubt
no longer; her strange speech, her wild
ways, her eyes sometimes startling me with
their brilliancy, sometimes paining me with
their sadness, admitted only of one interpretation.</p>

<p>My pen is powerless to describe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
feeling of misery that took possession of
me. The stern necessity of self-control
made the suffering more sharp. I dared
not by word or look hint my suspicion, lest
the avowal, however vague, might precipitate
the fruition of her madness. My apprehensions
exaggerated the results of observation,
and gave to her actions and language a
greater importance than they probably
deserved.</p>

<p>And all the long days were filled for me
with a weird and tearful pathos. For her
love grew greater and greater, grew to a
wildness and depth that marked her derangement
more plainly than any other
illustration. She followed me from room
to room, into the garden, sometimes at a
distance, sometimes at my side. She would
throw herself at my feet, rest her cheek on
my knee and look up at me with her large
and wonderful eyes, of which the beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
became more startling as her insanity grew
more vigorous.</p>

<p>I once fancied that her past held some
sorrow which might contribute to mature,
if it did not actually feed her madness. I
had little faith in my power of winning confession;
and her exquisite sensibilities and
my own clumsy judgment alike prohibited
the ordeal of examination. Yet I resolved
to question her, and did, at wide intervals,
and rather by implication than by direct
interrogation; but won no more from her
than she had before told me. She said that
her married life had been miserable, but that
its misery now was forgotten in my love.
She never recurred to it. She dared not.
She felt that she had been destined for me,
and she thought there was something
menacing to her future in remembering that
another one occupied the position that
should have been always mine. The task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of questioning was sadly embarrassed by
her inconsequential language. Day by day
her speech grew more incoherent. Instinct,
so far as her passions were concerned, supplied
the place of memory; her memory
grew visibly impaired. She could discuss
with pertinent consistency the first portion
of a topic; but the rest slipped from her,
and she fell with strange abruptness into
another subject, without manifesting the
slightest uneasiness at the sharp departures
of her mind.</p>

<p>I took counsel of Mrs. Williams, who
implored me to conceal my fears from my
wife.</p>

<p>"She is young, Sir," she said, "and her
reason may get the upper hand yet. It is
not as if she was utterly wild. If there's
much strangeness there's likewise much
sense in what she says. This proves she's
capable of reasoning; and there's no telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
at her time of life what nature mayn't do
for her."</p>

<p>"My position is terrible," I said. "This
kind of existence is life in death. It is
hard&mdash;it is hard to see one I love so well,
who loves me with so pure and rare a love,
slowly succumbing to this most awful of
human diseases. Cannot I save her? Would
a change benefit her, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it, Sir. It is not always thought
wise to change the residences of people so
afflicted. Their feelings will reason for them
when they are surrounded with familiar
things. If you bring them among strangers
and into strange places their poor faculties
haven't the power to grasp what they hear
and see. It's like cutting the thread that
supports them."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible that I can sit quietly
by and see her decaying, as it were, before
me. I must do something."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>"Would you like to have a doctor to see
her, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that. I have thought
of taking her to London. But what excuse
could I make&mdash;what would she think?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to have a doctor
down here, Sir?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it would," I replied, grasping
the idea at once. "I could pretend he
was a friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; and he wouldn't require to
stop longer than two or three days."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. He would see her in
all her moods and come to a conclusion on
which he would base his advice."</p>

<p>I was turning from her when she said,</p>

<p>"I believe, Sir, Mr. Martelli is at Cliffegate."</p>

<p>"Martelli?" I exclaimed, stopping short.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir, so Sarah says," (Sarah was
the housemaid). "She was that way <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>yesterday,
and says she saw him sitting on the
beach."</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe it. What should
Martelli do here?&mdash;unless, indeed, he has
taken a situation at a school&mdash;but you have
no schools here, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir. But it is quite likely Sarah
was mistaken. She was in a hurry, and the
gentleman she saw might well happen to be
a stranger. Yet she declares the person she
saw was Mr. Martelli."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has returned to Cliffegate
wishing to return to me: but it is out of
the question that I could receive him
now."</p>

<p>I retreated to the library and wrote a
letter to an old medical gentleman who was
long my mother's adviser and mine. I set
my position before him with the bluntness
I knew he relished, and asked him if he
could oblige me with the name of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
medical man who he thought would have
leisure and skill enough to carry out my
stratagem. He sent me a long reply, saying
he had spoken to a friend who had made
the treatment of insanity his study, who
would be happy to carry out my wishes.
To obviate all chance of exciting my wife's
suspicions he advised me to come to London
and settle the programme; "for," he continued,
"madness is often subtle enough to
mislead the most practised observer, and it
would therefore be absolutely necessary that
Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;'s visit to your house should be
so contrived as to seem perfectly consistent
with the excuse for his visit which you will
contrive."</p>

<p>I saw the wisdom of this and determined
to go to London.</p>

<p>As some pretence for my absence was
needful, I pretended that I had received a
letter on a business matter of great urgency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
A large sum, I said, was at stake, and my
presence in town was imperative. Geraldine
was very reluctant to let me go. Her large
eyes filled, and her beauty became mournful,
as though some great sorrow had entered her
heart.</p>

<p>"I shall be counting the hours, day and
night, until you return," she said. "But
how blank the time will be without you!
I shall not care to eat or drink, or go into
the garden. Is it not you who make all
those flowers beautiful, and this home dear
and sweet to me as heaven?"</p>

<p>"But I will not be long gone, Geraldine.
And do you not know that little separations
like these sweeten love, as the clouds in the
sky make the sunshine more brilliant when
their shadows pass?"</p>

<p>"Our love does not want brightening,"
she answered, with a sob. "But since you
must go, I will pray to the Blessed Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to watch over you and bring you safe back
to me; for though you do not love her as
I do, she loves you and will never forsake
you."</p>

<p>I kissed her, and in a few hours after we
parted.</p>

<p>I reached London late at night, and next
morning drove to the house of my friend.
He received me very cordially. I learned
to my regret that Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; had been suddenly
summoned to the death-bed of a near
relation, and was not likely to return for
three days. I thought more of Geraldine
than myself. But my friend consoled me by
saying that my absence might benefit her;
anxiety for my return would give definite
occupation to her mind; the longer indeed
my absence was protracted the better, for
fear and hope would steady by their weight
the vibrations of her reason, while expectancy
would serve as a leader to her thoughts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
marshal them and keep them in a kind of
logical order.</p>

<p>I wrote to her, saying that my return was
unavoidably delayed, but promised I would
do my utmost to be with her on Wednesday.
I added that in all probability I should
return with a friend, and desired her to tell
Mrs. Williams to get the spare room ready.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday afternoon I met Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash; by appointment at the house of my
friend. I found him reserved, but gentlemanly.
He asked me many questions about
my wife, to all which I replied as fully as
I could. He announced his willingness to
return with me and to give his opinion; and
in reply to my inquiry named a fee which
I thought sufficiently moderate.</p>

<p>We left London next morning by an early
train and reached Cornpool at about three
in the afternoon. I had telegraphed for my
phaeton to be in waiting and a little after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
four we halted at the gate of Elmore
Court.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams received us. I asked anxiously
after Geraldine. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; drew
near to hear the reply.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell what has come over her, Sir.
Since yesterday she has been as changed as
though she had been suddenly taken with
illness. She fretted a little after you left,
but she cleared up before long, and got
talking with me on the pleasure it gave her
to think of your return. I couldn't help
taking notice that she talked much more
rationally than she used, and I thought that
the health of her mind might be coming
back to her. But yesterday morning, when
she came down to breakfast, I was shocked
by her looks. She was white as a sheet;
her eyes rolled, and she talked so wildly and
quick I couldn't follow her. My fear was
that something had happened to you, Sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
But when I asked her if she had heard bad
news from master, she clutched me by the
arm and cried out piteously, 'Is there bad
news? is there bad news?' I answered,
'Not that I know of.' On which she left
me, and stood muttering to herself."</p>

<p>"But where is she now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She should be in the drawing-room,
Sir."</p>

<p>I did not stop to ask if she had expected
me; but directing Mrs. Williams to conduct
Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; to his bedroom ran to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>I found her walking to and fro with her
hands behind her. Mrs. Williams was right.
An extraordinary change had come over her
since we parted. Her face was ashen pale;
beneath her eyes the flesh had fallen and
turned dark; her eyes flashed, but a look
of fear came into her face when she saw
me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>"Geraldine&mdash;dear Geraldine!" I cried,
approaching her with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>She stood stock still, then all at once
bounded forward with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"It is my darling boy!" she said, throwing
her arms around my neck.</p>

<p>I kissed her; but I felt her tremble in my
embrace. I led her to a sofa.</p>

<p>"Did you not expect me, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew you would come."</p>

<p>"And you would not receive me at the
door?"</p>

<p>"Have you not come to me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have. But, dearest, you
look ill. Has anything happened since we
parted?"</p>

<p>"What should happen?" she said, pushing
my hair off my forehead. "But I am
sick&mdash;I am sick for wanting you."</p>

<p>"I could not come before, as I told you.
But now that you have me, will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
brighten up? I do not like your worn air.
Those white cheeks do not become you."</p>

<p>"You will give me health, Arthur."</p>

<p>"If God permits me!" I said fervently,
pained by the great pathos of her eyes and
the troubled frightened expression of her
face. "I have brought a friend with me,
Geraldine. Perhaps he will help me to
make you well."</p>

<p>"What friend?"</p>

<p>"Did not I tell you of my intention to
bring a friend from London?"</p>

<p>"Did you?" she asked, with a bewildered
look. Then feeling in her pocket she produced
my letter. "How often have I
kissed it!" she said, as though to herself;
"but I do not want it, now that I have him
with me."</p>

<p>"There," said I, opening the letter and
pointing to the passage in it: "do you not
remember reading those lines?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>She knitted her brow like one in deep
reflection; and looking up, with her face
softened with rather the shadow of a smile
than a smile, answered, "Yes&mdash;I ran with
it to Mrs. Williams and told her to get the
spare room ready."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and a servant
ushered in Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;. I rose and introduced
him to Geraldine. He bowed with
polite reserve. She inclined her head and
sat watching him as a child might.</p>

<p>He appeared to take no notice of her.
He began a light conversation with me,
wandering from topic to topic, evidently
with the design of engaging her attention
and inducing her to speak. Now and then
I caught him looking at her.</p>

<p>She rose after a little, as if his presence
made her uneasy, and went to the window;
but soon returned and resumed her seat by
my side. All at once she asked:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>"Are you an old friend of my husband?"</p>

<p>"We have known each other some time."</p>

<p>"How came you to meet?"</p>

<p>"We met at the house of a common
friend."</p>

<p>"Were you <i>very</i> pleased to see him?"</p>

<p>He answered with a smile, "It is always
pleasing to meet with one's friends."</p>

<p>"Arthur," she said, turning to me, "it
is not fair in you to call anyone 'friend'
but me. 'Acquaintance' is what you should
call everybody but Geraldine."</p>

<p>"I call you my wife, dearest; and that
is a higher name than all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fenton," she said, addressing him
by the name I had introduced him by, "do
you think Arthur has any friend who would
mourn if he left him for only a day?"</p>

<p>"He is fortunate if he has, Mrs. Thorburn."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<p>"I did, Mr. Fenton. And has he a
friend who, if he were lying ill, would wish
to be ill too? who, if he were dying would
wish to be dying? who, if he were dead,
would kill himself, if he could not die for
grief, that he might be by his side in the
grave?" Her eyes sparkled, her nostrils
dilated; she added proudly: "He has only
one friend who would wish all this for his
dear sake, and she is his wife."</p>

<p>"I am sure he is very sensible of your
devotion," he answered, gravely.</p>

<p>She again left my side. So restless was
she that even when she was seated her form
swayed like one who is ever about to rise.
Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and I exchanged looks. She
abruptly called from the window, "Mr.
Fenton, have you seen the garden?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Mrs. Thorburn," he answered,
approaching her.</p>

<p>"Come, Arthur," she called, "we will
show Mr. Fenton our flowers."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>I wished them to be alone, so I answered
that I would change my coat and then join
them. Saying which I left the room.</p>

<p>But I was hardly in the hall before she
came running after me. She took my hand
and kissed it, saying, "Do you think I can
be away from you?"</p>

<p>"But you should not leave our guest
alone, Geraldine. I will join you in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"What is our guest compared to you,
Arthur? Have you not been away from
me? It was cruel to bring that man here;
he comes between us; you are not <i>all</i> my
own now. He will require your attention,
and I shall <i>hate</i> him because you give it. I
will ask him to go away."</p>

<p>I detained her by the hand, fearing she
would actually carry out her threat.</p>

<p>"If you love me, darling," I said, "you
will be courteous to this gentleman. You
will not refuse me this favour."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>"If you asked me to love him, I would
try to love him," she answered submissively,
her lips tremulous, her eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"That would make me jealous. I only
want you to be courteous. Return to him
now, show him over the grounds, and justify
my great love for you by letting him see
how sweet you can be."</p>

<p>She gave me a long look and returned to
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>When afterwards I went downstairs I
stood at the window watching them before
I entered the grounds. They were traversing
a broad walk. She looked incessantly
towards the house; but sometimes she would
loiter with an air of strange <i>abandon</i>, or bend
to pick a flower and follow her companion
with a bound.</p>

<p>Alas! I did not need Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; to confirm
my fears. There was not a look, a
remark, even an attitude of hers, that did
not now insinuate derangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
How she loved me! Those earnest glances
at the house were for me. Pitiful it was to
think on such a passion corrupted by madness.
What a sorrowful pageant her beauty,
her devotion, her innocence made! It was
the Dance of Death; the graces marshalled
by a skeleton. Was I worthy of her love?
Yes, for I loved her well, too. She must
have known it, to have been so fond of me.
Instinct in this stood her in the place of
reason. She loved me with her spirit; she
recognised my love by the faculties of her
spirit. Had her brain interpreted her experiences
her devotion must have been less
deep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>That night Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and I sat in the
library. Geraldine had retired to rest. Up
to that moment we had found no opportunity
for conversation, for she was always
near, always at my side.</p>

<p>I had marked his incessant study of her.
I had admired the skill with which he
directed her attention&mdash;as a steersman directs
his bark; provoking her into speech, perplexing
her views to ascertain the consistency
of her mind, then helping her thoughts, to
witness whether her incoherence were due
to normal weakness of intellect or to
disease.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>He had lighted a cigar and sat smoking
in silence&mdash;a silence I feared to question.
From time to time he looked at me,
with pity rather than embarrassment, and
at last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorburn, I should be intruding
upon your hospitality were I to
remain over to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I understand. You have no doubt?"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>I mastered an emotion with a struggle.</p>

<p>"Will you give me your opinion?" I
said.</p>

<p>"My opinion is that your wife is
insane. It is impossible that I should pronounce
upon the degree of her insanity
from the short time I have been with
her. The conditions with which she is
surrounded must necessarily retard the
growth of her madness. Her love for
you and your presence here exercise a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
a restraining influence. Yet I am not
satisfied that her mind is free from
anxiety."</p>

<p>"What makes you think this?"</p>

<p>"I judge more from her aspect than
her manners or language. Her physical
condition implies the presence of some active
mental pain, which is not due to insanity,
though it would aggravate it."</p>

<p>"But what could pain her? She is
perfectly happy in my love. She will not
suffer me to remove her from this house.
Would society benefit her?"</p>

<p>"I think not. If she objects to it she
has her reason, and it would distress
her."</p>

<p>"Would a change of air, would a change
of scene, be of use? I am rich, doctor;
do not scruple to prescribe. If my fortune
would benefit her, it should be
spent."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can prescribe only one thing&mdash;will
you surrender her to my care?"</p>

<p>"No. I could not part with her."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised. Even if I took
charge of her, I could not guarantee her
recovery."</p>

<p>"I will take charge of her myself.
She would never bear being separated
from me."</p>

<p>"In one sense," he replied, "you would
make a better guardian than I. But the
duty of watching the mad is very painful&mdash;especially
when the insane person is
one we love."</p>

<p>"But you do not think she requires watching
yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I mean that there is no
need of vigilant scrutiny, though I should
advise you to keep her well in view. Her
madness has not yet emphatically pronounced
itself&mdash;but it may do so any day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
You must humour her. Her love gives
you an influence which no one else could
easily possess. I predict, that when her
insane moods are most vehement she
will prove docile to you." He added,
after a pause, "you should procure some
woman whom you can trust to watch her.
But not yet. Give her perfect freedom
now. But when you find it needful to
restrain her&mdash;and that time I fear will come&mdash;appoint
some keeper of whose humanity
and patience you can have proofs."</p>

<p>"Have you no hope that she will
recover?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible for me to pronounce.
From the character of the disease in her,
I should say it would grow; but its culmination
may not be intense. Neither good
health nor good spirits will much profit her.
Illness, indeed, is sometimes beneficial to madness.
I once had a patient under my charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
whom I considered incurable. He was
seized with scarlet fever, which was within
an ace of killing him. He escaped death
by a miracle, and when the delirium
passed, I found he had recovered his
mind."</p>

<p>"But in the case of my wife, should
you think her madness hereditary or acquired?"</p>

<p>"There again you puzzle me. It would
be necessary for me to hear Mrs. Thorburn's
history before I could hazard a
conjecture."</p>

<p>"Her history is brief. She married a
man who ill-treated her. Her sufferings
must have been great, for it has made her
detest the world and shun society like a
plague. But I can discern no madness in
this. It would be the natural attitude of
a young mind embittered by wrong.</p>

<p>"As you say, her attitude is no proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of madness, but the cause that forced
her into that attitude may have induced
madness."</p>

<p>"You would attribute her derangement
to her first husband's ill-treatment?"</p>

<p>"Her ill-treatment may have been one
cause. If there were a previous disposition
to madness a very painful experience would
hardly fail to excite it. In my own mind,
I have little doubt that she is oppressed
with some recollection, of which the removal
would benefit, if it did not cure
her."</p>

<p>"Surely, I should be able to ascertain
it?"</p>

<p>"Better than any one else. But you
will have to be very cautious in your
approaches. Yet you will hardly need
tuition in such a matter. Your knowledge
of her character will teach you
better how to act than any suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
from a stranger. With respect to myself,
I do not see that I can be of any further
use to you. Indeed, I doubt if my stay
here would be advisable. My presence
irritates her; and it must be your business
to keep her mind as composed and tranquil
as possible."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly in your hands, doctor;
and however you may act, I am sure it will
be for the best."</p>

<p>We remained together until after twelve.
Our conversation was entirely restricted to
the one subject. He had had much experience
of madness and illustrated the
information I gave him respecting my wife's
derangement by anecdotes of corresponding
peculiarities in other cases he had met with.
On separating, I conducted him to his room,
and then returned to see after the house
for the night, as was my custom. At
the bottom of the staircase I met Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Williams, candle in hand, going to bed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we have kept you up rather
late," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh! never mention that, Sir. I only
trust and pray that the doctor's visit here
may be of use."</p>

<p>"Of no use, I fear," I replied, "except to
confirm my sorrow. He does not doubt
that she is insane."</p>

<p>"I feared so, I feared so," she said, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>"He will leave to-morrow, for he can be
of no further service here; and he thinks his
presence irritates her."</p>

<p>"He is right, Sir. Mistress came to me
this evening, and told me it was as much as
she could do to speak civilly to him. 'What
does he want in this house?' she said.
'Mr. Thorburn can't be with me as he used
before this man came. And he vexes me so,
Mrs. Williams. He asks me questions it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
pains my head to answer; and I don't like
his eyes;' and here she began to cry."</p>

<p>"Well, he leaves us in the morning. He
is keen-sighted and honourable, and sees
that his presence can do no good. I have
been troubling myself to guess what could
have worked such a change in Mrs. Thorburn
during my absence. The alteration is
too sudden to be due to illness. Nor is she
ill."</p>

<p>"It all came at once, Sir. She was well
over night, and next morning, as I told you,
I met her looking downright changed."</p>

<p>"Did she not seem suffering at all the
night before?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, I went to bed at about half-past
ten, and left her in the library. I
thought she might be writing to you."</p>

<p>"Am I to believe," I said, "that a sudden
access of insanity would effect such a change?
It is possible. Some horror may have seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
her in the night. God only knows what
dreadful fancies the diseased mind will
generate to craze the brain. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
has told me I must expect her madness to
increase, and that it will be necessary to
procure some one to watch her. Mrs.
Williams, would you undertake such a
duty?"</p>

<p>"I would not object, Sir. I would do it
from pity. She is so delicate and sweet with
all her strangeness, that I could not have
the heart to see her in anybody else's
charge."</p>

<p>"By doing this you would be bestowing
on me an obligation I could not repay. It
would almost mitigate my grief to think she
was tended by one so worthy and kind as
you. Rest assured I shall do my utmost
to recompense you for the trying position
you will be placed in."</p>

<p>She curtesied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>"I only beg you will keep the secret. I
shall continue residing here until I see what
form her madness takes. Where else could
I secure such privacy&mdash;such perfect security
from intrusion? From my heart of hearts I
humbly pray God to avert from her and me
this most terrible calamity. But if it be His
will that her madness should strengthen,
then we will watch over her as we would
over some stricken infant. I may expect
tenderness and love for her from you, Mrs.
Williams. You will think of my devotion,
and will take my place when I am from her
side; and cherish, and bear with her; for
she deserves it&mdash;she deserves it! So young,
so beautiful, so fond&mdash;to be blighted like
this!"</p>

<p>I buried my face in my hands and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"I will do for her, Sir, as if she was my
own child," said Mrs. Williams in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>tremulous
tone, moved by my grief. "She shall
never want for love while she is with
me."</p>

<p>I took and pressed the kind creature's
hand, and passed into the library. The
window stood open as I had left it, for the
night, though it was the autumn, was close.
I entered the balcony. The air was dark;
there was no moon; the stars were few
and faint. The wind stole through the
trees which towered above the house with
a hollow plaining.</p>

<p>The gloom and stillness were friendly to
thought and melancholy. Away down there
among those black shadows I had first met
her, walking with a queenly air, her face
made marble by sleep, her eyes made sightless
by the slumbering of her soul. Into
what a life had her beauty led me! The intelligence
of my spirit had not deceived me.
Had it not inspired me with prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
forebodings of some such commingling of
mine and this fair creature's destinies as was
now realised? Of what sin had I been
guilty to merit this dread expiation? My
love was pure; why was it made a
misery?</p>

<p>I was in the act of leaving the balcony
when I heard a cry&mdash;a human cry, as of
some one in pain or distress. It smote my
ear&mdash;faint but defined; but whence it had
come, whether from right or left of me, or
from the deep black shadows of the trees
beyond, I knew not. I stood straining my
hearing to catch the cry again, but it was
not repeated.</p>

<p>Was it a human voice? I might have
been mistaken. It might have been the dull
note of some wakeful bird, humanised by
my imagination. It might have been the
moan of some homeless dog. I waited wondering.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>All at once my thoughts rushed to
Geraldine. The cry might have come from
her room; its passage through the open
window making it sound as though uttered
in the garden.</p>

<p>I mounted the stairs gently and opened
the bedroom door. A candle burnt on the
toilet-table. I glanced at the bed; it was
empty, yet her form had pressed it, and the
clothes were disordered.</p>

<p>I hastened downstairs, possessed with a
strange belief; I entered the balcony, passed
down the steps, and gained the garden.
I walked forward cautiously, peering to
right and left, pausing at intervals to
listen, then advancing noiselessly as before.
Half-way down the grounds I stopped;
I heard the sound of footsteps. In a
few minutes a figure in white came
out of the gloom and flitted rapidly by
me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>I called "Geraldine!" She halted. I
went up to her.</p>

<p>"My darling, what are you doing in the
garden at this hour? The grass is wet, and
you are thinly clad."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked in a hard
whisper.</p>

<p>"Your husband&mdash;Arthur."</p>

<p>"Let me feel you."</p>

<p>I took her hand and led her to the house.
She did not speak until we had gained
the library. By the light of the candle I
saw that her eyes were dilated, her face
quite bloodless, her lips thin, white and
rigid.</p>

<p>"Great God, Geraldine! Speak! What
is the matter with you?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Let me get to bed&mdash;I am weary, weary,"
she answered.</p>

<p>I closed the window and accompanied her
to our bedroom. She moaned like one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
under the influence of a narcotic. Her face
was almost deformed by the harshness of
its expression. Her fingers worked incessantly,
like those of an infant in a sick
slumber.</p>

<p>"Were you walking in your sleep
Geraldine?" I asked.</p>

<p>She answered with extraordinary quickness,
"Yes, I have been walking in my sleep."</p>

<p>"I heard a cry; did you utter it?"</p>

<p>She laughed quietly, but without the least
change of expression.</p>

<p>"Who else?&mdash;who else?" she replied.</p>

<p>"But did you hurt yourself, that you
cried out?"</p>

<p>A shrewd light shone in her eyes as she
answered:</p>

<p>"I stumbled; the fall awoke me, and in
my fear I cried out."</p>

<p>She began to play with her hair, suddenly
desisted, and asked querulously,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>"What makes this room red?"</p>

<p>"It is not red, dearest."</p>

<p>"I say it is!" she exclaimed, irritably.
"The flame of the candle is red&mdash;the walls
are red&mdash;your face is red!"</p>

<p>"Your nerves are excited. The shock of
awakening has been too great. Lie down,
dearest; you will rise refreshed in the
morning."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the edge of the bed,
looking at her fingers and turning them
about. Presently she began to cry, but very
quietly. I went to her and kissed her, clasping
her in my arms for she trembled as
though she were cold. And indeed she was;
her hands and cheeks were like ice; but her
forehead burned. After a little I succeeded
in coaxing her into bed, where she lay sighing
as though her heart would break. I
watched by her for half an hour, when the
regular respiration told me she was asleep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>When she rose next morning she looked
very very ill. I was greatly distressed by
her appearance and entreated her to remain
in bed. But she declared she must get up;
what could she do in bed? She had some
work in the garden, and must go to it. I
could not help taking notice of her constrained
manner, as though she addressed me
under compulsion. She appeared to have
difficulty in articulating her words; and her
eyes, which the sickness of her body seemed
to make more brilliant, were restless, startled,
and impatient. Before leaving the room she
said:</p>

<p>"I do not like your friend, Arthur; when
will he go?"</p>

<p>"He is going to-day, love."</p>

<p>"Why did he come?"</p>

<p>Bound to be consistent, I repeated my
story of his being a friend whom I had asked
to spend a week at Elmore Court, but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
now found he would have to return to
London that day.</p>

<p>"What time will he leave?"</p>

<p>"In the early part of the afternoon, I
think."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to see him. I'll go into
the garden and hide myself. Do you know,
when he looks at me his eyes give me a pain
in the head?"</p>

<p>"I am sure he does not wish to pain
you."</p>

<p>"But he does, or he would not look at
me like that. And he asks me questions
which trouble me to reply to. I won't meet
him."</p>

<p>"Very well," I answered, recollecting Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash;'s advice that she should be humoured.</p>

<p>"And do not bring him near me," she
continued, "and do not come and look for
me, for I shall hide myself until he is
gone."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>"But you are not strong enough to work
in the garden. Why will you not remain
indoors? Let Mrs. Williams nurse you a
little. You need repose after what happened
last night."</p>

<p>"What happened last night?" she cried,
looking sharply up.</p>

<p>If the memory of it had passed, I thought
it best not to recall it. So I answered:</p>

<p>"I am sure, dearest, you need a little
nursing. And should you fatigue yourself in
the garden"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me of last night," she whispered,
creeping close to me.</p>

<p>"Why," I replied, marking her resolution
to be answered, "do you not remember finding
yourself walking in your sleep?"</p>

<p>She tossed her hands and laughed out.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember! But go you
downstairs and detain your friend while I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
pass. I will breakfast in the housekeeper's
room. Tell him I am ill and cannot be seen."</p>

<p>"Very well," I answered, reluctantly. It
did not please me to leave her to herself.
Her face looked wax-like, so delicate and
transparent was the white of her skin, and
her eyes actually trembled with the light in
them, as though they reflected the rays of
some flickering flame.</p>

<p>I found Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; in the breakfast-room.
I gave him a brief account of what had
happened on the previous night, and of
her condition. I also acquainted him with
the aversion he had inspired her with. He
replied that her aversion was an illustration
of his influence over insane persons. The
first operation of this influence was hate and
distrust; but fear soon followed. The motto
of the mad doctor, he added, was the expression
of the Roman emperor&mdash;<i>oderint dum
metuant</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>"She refuses to meet you," I said, "and
has gone to hide herself among the trees.
You will require no apology for this behaviour,"
I added, with a mournful smile.</p>

<p>"You do right to let her have her own
way. Yet you see how necessary her dislike
makes my departure?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is not wholly impossible that
her cunning may have conjectured the truth,
and that she has guessed your mission."</p>

<p>"I should hardly think that; though you
are right in accrediting insanity with a power
of perception which is often far beyond the
reach of intellect. The decay of the brain
seems to bring the functions of the spirit into
activity. But this perception does not always
refer to material things. Its proper dominion
is the immaterial. Where reason sees order,
insanity witnesses disorder; but, on the other
hand, insanity riots in the chaos that lies
without the limits of normal thought, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
delights in constructing theories and forms
from the thrice-confounded abstractions it
seems to contemplate."</p>

<p>"This would account for many of its
delusions."</p>

<p>"After a fashion. But it is hard to reason
on the reasonless. The worst form of madness
is the total subversion of the intellectual
faculties; when the mind represents everything
totally opposite to what it is. I
remember hearing of two lovers who went
mad through a cruel separation. When they
were brought together they recognised each
other, but each denied the other to be the
beloved one. A distinguished mathematician
went mad through mistaking the number 6
for an 0 in all his calculations."</p>

<p>"We can appreciate the horror of madness
when it is brought home to us. Much
surely may be done by tenderness and
sympathy?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>"They are both severely taxed. I do not
utterly despair of your wife, though she will
have to be worse before she is better. My
parting advice, Mr. Thorburn, is to endeavour
to ascertain if she is at all troubled in her mind.
If a real sorrow lies there it should be uprooted;
if an imaginary woe it must be reasoned
away. You must have patience; watch her
narrowly; sound her persistently, though
with delicacy, and keep her as cheerful as
opportunity will allow."</p>

<p>A reference to the time-tables showed a
train to be leaving Cornpool at twelve.
Having ordered the phaeton to be in readiness,
we went for a walk towards the sea.
It was his own wish to keep away from the
house. The walk was hardly agreeable; my
mood was sombre and melancholy, and all
my thoughts were with Geraldine. On our
return we found the phaeton waiting, and
having pressed a cheque into his hand, I
bade him farewell.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>When Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; was gone I went in
search of Geraldine. I met a servant and
asked for Mrs. Thorburn; she answered
that her mistress had just come in from the
garden and had gone upstairs. I mounted
to the bedroom, and found the door locked.
I rapped and called to her to admit me.
The key was turned, the door opened, and
Geraldine stood before me, with the skirt of
her dress off, her arms bared to the elbows,
and her hair wild. "Come in," she said;
and when I was in she locked the door
again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>I noticed that her hands and arms were
covered with soil; there were fragments of
dry leaves in her hair, and on the carpet,
from the door to the toilet-table, were marks
of her muddy boots. There was a keen
look of triumph on her white face; and
sharp curves at the extremity of her lips
made the expression of her mouth malevolent.</p>

<p>I pretended to take no notice of her appearance.
She went to the washstand, brimmed
the basin and began to wash.</p>

<p>"My friend is gone," said I; "you will
have me now all to yourself."</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder and nodded.</p>

<p>"I rather fancy he guessed you did not
like him," I continued; "for he expressed
no surprise at your absence, nor did he
desire to bid you good-bye."</p>

<p>"There was a little devil in each of his
eyes," she replied; "mocking imps, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
made mouths at me and frightened me."</p>

<p>"That is strange. It appeared to me that
he had a kind eye."</p>

<p>She splashed the water violently over her
arms, and sponged her face, repeating this
many times. I waited until her ablutions
were ended, and asked, "Where have you
been, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"In the garden, digging, until my arms
are tired; and now my head aches."</p>

<p>"But what is there to dig, dear? The
beds are in order."</p>

<p>"I wanted exercise, and so I took a spade
and dug. I was in a mood for digging.
It pleased me to drive the sharp spade into
the soft earth and fling it up all quivering.
I was in a passion; and I dug a grave for
my passion."</p>

<p>"Have you been resting under the trees?
There are fragments of leaves in your hair?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how they came there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Perhaps I dashed the leaves about with my
spade. Will you brush my hair out?"</p>

<p>She seated herself before the toilet-glass.
How pallid and deadly was the reflection of
her face! I loosened her yellow tresses;
they flowed over my arm like silk. From
time to time I caught sight of her black and
glittering eyes watching me; but their lashes
veiled them each time I met their gaze.</p>

<p>"I wish I could put a little colour into
your marble cheeks, Geraldine. It makes
me very sad to see you so pale."</p>

<p>"I would not make my boy sad for
much," she answered.</p>

<p>"You were well when I left you; there
must be some reason for this change."</p>

<p>"No reason, no reason," she answered,
sighing.</p>

<p>"If there is any cause for your illness or
for this change, if your heart is oppressed
with any trouble or misgiving, if you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
not perfectly happy in your mind&mdash;why will
you not take me into your confidence? Is
it not my privilege to share your sorrows?
If you are sad and will not tell me the cause
of your sadness, must I not fear that you
do not think I love you well enough to
deserve your confidence?"</p>

<p>"Do I distrust your love? I do not. I
am happy in your love."</p>

<p>"If you know how well I love you you
must be happy; for no one was ever loved
more truly than you."</p>

<p>"Do not talk so, Arthur. Let me feel
your love, not hear it."</p>

<p>"Is there anything in the past that grieves
you to remember, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she raised her hand solemnly.
"I have buried the past. It will grieve me
no more."</p>

<p>"But its ghost may walk," I said, hoping
to make myself more intelligible by adopting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
her tone. "Tell me how I may find it, that
I may bid it depart and leave you in
peace."</p>

<p>"Should it come, it will not go for you,"
she said, shaking her head. "Ghosts are
deaf, and heed no prayers. They are spirits
and have no fears. The air is full of them
sometimes. I hear their voices, and when
the room is dark I see their shapes. They
are more white than that face," pointing to
her reflection; "and they have steady un-winking
eyes and long shadowy hands. Do
you never see them? They often stand at
the foot of the bed and watch us."</p>

<p>"These are foolish fancies, Geraldine.
See, I have brushed your hair well. Will
you do it up?"</p>

<p>She took the tresses in her hands mechanically
and bound them in the fashion she
wore them.</p>

<p>"You do not play the piano as you used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Geraldine. I have heard that ghosts hate
music as much as they hate sunshine or anything
else that is cheerful. When you have
got on your dress, come down-stairs and
play me something, and you shall hear me
sing. I had a voice once."</p>

<p>"I do not care to play," she answered
wearily.</p>

<p>"You have tired yourself with digging.
Lie down a little and I will fetch a book
and read you to sleep."</p>

<p>"I could not lie down. How strong the
light is! Draw the curtains."</p>

<p>I did as she bade me, and took a chair at
the window.</p>

<p>"Do not watch me so, Arthur," she said
peevishly. "You have learned that trick
from your friend. Your eyes seem as sharp
as his."</p>

<p>I averted my face, leaning my cheek on
my hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>"When you dig the earth how the horrible
worms crawl out! I cut one into four
pieces yesterday, and not one piece was dead
when I left. When I die, do not bury me
in the ground, but throw me as I am in the
sea. The ground is dark and rotting, but
the sea is fresh. I can shut my eyes so, and
feel myself there. There," pointing in the
air, "is a huge black shadow floating over
me like a cloud. Great eyes, each with a
hundred circles, stare at me through the
green water. There goes a great outline,
brilliant as a rainbow, white, yellow, black,
blue&mdash;&mdash;oh! how horrible it is to die!" she
suddenly screamed, clasping her hands and
staring at me wildly.</p>

<p>I passed my arm round her neck, kissed
her cold cheek, and tried to soothe her.
She turned in her chair, burying her face
in my breast and trembling from hand to
foot. She disengaged herself presently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
walked with uncertain steps to the bed, and
put on her skirt.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing you can do, my poor
wife, to clear your mind of these distressing
fancies?" I asked. "If you would try to
fix your mind upon something, however unimportant,
it might create an interest and
give you food for thought."</p>

<p>"Are not other people haunted like I
am?"</p>

<p>"Many, I dare say. We all should be,
if we did not resolve not to be. Why, were
I to encourage superstitious feelings, I could
make myself the most unhappy wretch in
the world in less than a week. Will was
given us expressly that we might control our
humours, and passions, and weaknesses.
You have the will; you only want the resolution
to exercise it."</p>

<p>"What can my will do for me? If I were
to grind my teeth and clench my hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
declare I <i>would</i> not think, could I stop
thinking? Oh! it is enough to drive me
mad!"</p>

<p>She began to talk to herself and moved
about the room, prowling rather than walking;
looking uneasily above, then staring at
herself in the glass, shaking her head and
catching at the fingers of her left hand.
Suddenly she stopped, and called out.
"Why will you look at me, Arthur? You
are growing unkind. You used not to look
at me before like that." And she began to
sob.</p>

<p>"It is my love that makes me look at
you; but I will not look if it gives you
pain;" and I turned to the window, and
stared out with as heavy a heart as ever a
man had.</p>

<p>She fell to singing to herself a little
melodious air with Italian words, of which
I caught only the first line;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ben veggio che'l mio fin consenti e vuoi,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and breaking suddenly off, she stole up to
me, threw her arms around my neck, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Will you be glad when I am dead?"</p>

<p>"I should wish to die too."</p>

<p>"I wish," she continued, in a half-chanting
dreamy voice, "we could pass
into heaven as we are, without dying. I
would take your hand, and we would float
to the stars, up through the still air, and on
and on, until we came to the City of God.
There we should be met by the Angel of
Peace, who would lead us to the thrones of
the Blessed Virgin and her dear Son, and in
their holy presence&mdash;&mdash;look!" she cried,
pointing over my shoulder to the garden,
"there is a white form rising&mdash;do you see
it? I can see the trees through its body&mdash;how
steadily it soars! yet it has no wings.
I follow it. Look, Arthur."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>Hitherto I had not been looking at her
as she had desired. Now I turned. Her
eyes were wide open, with a fixed stare on
the sky; her lips were parted, and she
breathed with deep respirations. Presently,
she bowed her head, made a gesture with
her hand, and crossing herself, muttered,
"It is gone."</p>

<p>"Come," said I, taking her hand, "let
us go downstairs."</p>

<p>That night, whilst I was pacing the
balcony, pondering my position, and less
lamenting it than deploring my powerlessness
to save my wife from the calamity whose
shadow was now on her, it entered my head
to search her boxes or trunks for any papers
or letters that might throw some light on her
past.</p>

<p>Under any other circumstances, I should
have dismissed such a resolution from my
mind. A wife may have secrets, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
husband should respect them. But Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
had intimated his fear that her madness was
being fed by some sorrow. To have discovered,
that I might remove, her sorrow,
I would have been guilty of any mean act.
I did not love myself so well as I loved
her.</p>

<p>I pretty well knew I had not been born
with the detective faculty, and apprehended
that my search would be defeated by clumsiness.
Still I resolved to attempt it. My
wife had several trunks ranged in my
dressing-room, and one of those large boxes
draped with chintz, called ottomans.</p>

<p>It was midnight before I retired to rest.
I had other things to think of besides this
search. The titles of my books, as they
looked down from the shelves, had preached
a solemn homily on the vanity of human
wishes: and my own experience capped the
moral by presenting me with a picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the life I was leading, done in colours as
sombre as fancy and reality could supply.
When I got upstairs I found Geraldine
asleep. I bent over her, and studied her
features. The complexion was so white that
the outline of her cheek was hardly perceptible
upon the pillow. Her beauty had a
pinched, worn air. All its calm and freshness
were gone; her brow was knitted,
her lip curled in a sneer; she lay quite still,
breathing deeply. The general expression
of her face was wretchedness. It was pitiful
to witness such a look on lineaments so beautiful.</p>

<p>I took the candle with me into the dressing-room,
and tried the lids of the boxes.
They were open. That of the ottoman only
was locked. I sought for her keys in the
pockets of some dresses hanging in the wardrobe
and found them in a green silk skirt.
I turned the ottoman inside out, but found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
nothing. I applied myself to the trunks,
but they were as barren of information as
the ottoman. I closed the lid of the last
trunk and was about passing from the room,
when I heard the sound of a door opened.
I listened, then pushed the dressing-room
door, and looked out. The bed was empty,
the door of the chamber open. I caught a
light sound of feet, and stealing to the
landing, perceived Geraldine descending the
stairs.</p>

<p>I followed her. She gained the hall; I
drew near. A lamp that was kept burning
all night diffused a sufficient light. I looked
at her face, and by the expression saw that
she walked in her sleep.</p>

<p>I did not dare arouse her. I had read of
the danger of awakening persons from such
trances, and Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; had particularly cautioned
me against doing so with my wife. I
could do no more than follow her; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
I resolved to do to preserve her from harm.
She walked steadily to the door leading to the
back grounds, unbolted it, and passed out.
The night air blew chill, for autumn was
advanced and the approach of winter could
be tasted in the night winds. The moon lay
over the trees, slowly brightening, but
shedding little light as yet. But the grounds
and shadows were defined. She seemed
sensible of the chill; for she crossed her
hands upon her bosom and huddled her
shoulders. She was habited only in her
nightgown and her feet were naked. The
dew was heavy; the gravelled walks sharp;
yet I dared not wake her.</p>

<p>She passed down the lawn, got on to a
side walk, and marched with slow but steady
step towards the orchard. Soon she entered
it. The shadows were deep, but the moonlight
fell through the openings and faintly
illuminated the obscurity. The grass stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
knee deep. My feet crunched the dead
leaves and snapped the rotten twigs. It was
a portion of the grounds left untouched by
the gardeners at my own request. The
contrast between the trimmed gardens and
the wild luxuriant orchard pleased me.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shadows and the intervening
trunks of the trees made it difficult for
me to follow her. I wondered whither she
was leading me. How utterly still was the
place! Her naked feet made no noise as
she advanced. Her form flitted and floated
before me in the gloom like a spectre. She
wound her way in and out among the trees
with precision, while I blundered forward,
sometimes stumbling with my shoulder
against a black trunk, sometimes kicking
and nearly falling over long iron-hard
roots.</p>

<p>Before long she gained the extremity of
the orchard. The hedge that intersected her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
former house from the grounds rose thick
and black. She stood motionless awhile,
then knelt and began to scrape the earth
with her hands, throwing the dried leaves
furiously about her. Presently she desisted,
rose, and went through a pantomime, the
significance of which the gloom forbade me
to interpret; but it appeared to me as though
she struggled with some invisible object.
She breathed heavily and chokingly, and
sometimes faint cries escaped her. Then
down she dropped on her knees again, and
fell to sweeping back the leaves in the same
violent way she had before scattered them.
This done, she left the place, passing me so
close that I had to shrink lest she should
touch me.</p>

<p>She went towards the house fleetly. I had
to walk quickly to keep up with her. At
times she almost ran. As I feared she would
shut the door upon me if I were behind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
so prevent me from entering, for the other
doors and the windows were bolted and
closed, I ran by her and stood in the passage
until she entered. It happened as I expected.
She closed the door at once and
bolted it precisely as she had found it. I
followed her upstairs, saw her get into bed
and lie as motionless as when I had first bent
over her.</p>

<p>I seated myself and watched her. I found
nothing strange in her actions in the orchard.
The mere fact of walking in her sleep was
sufficient to render consistent any extraordinary
behaviour. But I dreaded the consequence
of her exposure to the night air. I
could not doubt the wonderful providence
that watched over the actions of the somnambulist;
but supernatural as might be the
regulation of her conduct, I knew that her
flesh would still be susceptible of ill, and
that there could be no provision made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
against the dangers of sickness and disease.</p>

<p>There was to be no sleep for me that
night. I felt so wide awake that I saw it
would be useless getting to bed. I was
agitated and superstitious. The house was
so still that I could hear the ticking of the
clock in the hall. The wind swept past the
windows at intervals and faintly rattled the
casements.</p>

<p>How calmly she slept! I could not reconcile
her profound slumber with the misery in
her face. Was there a sorrow there, or was
it her madness that made her face so plaintive?
If a sorrow, why should it be undiscoverable?
I had searched her boxes;
what else remained to be searched? I went
to the wardrobe, noiselessly pulled out the
drawers and examined them. In the top
drawer was her jewel case. It was open. I
raised the tray; there was nothing there
beyond a few articles of jewelry. I inspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the middle drawer. Here was her desk; a
large old-fashioned rosewood box, at which
I had once or twice found her writing in the
dressing-room. It was locked. I took the
keys, fitted the right one, and opened the
desk. There were papers here, at all events;
bundles of letters, some of them yellow and
faded, connected by bits of elastic.</p>

<p>Eager as I was to know the truth <i>for her
sake</i>, I found my curiosity strongly repelled
by my sense of delicacy and honour. Before
I could force myself to open the bundle I
held, I had to subdue my aversion to the
task by recalling the benefit she would derive
by my knowing her past. That the rustling
of the papers should not disturb her, I retreated
with the desk to the dressing-room,
leaving the door ajar, that I might hear if she
moved. I then trimmed the light and addressed
myself to my necessary but odious
task.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>The letters were numerous. I read them
all. Some of them were addressed to her
by her grandmother. Some were written in
a foreign hand and signed Luigi. They told
me only a portion of her story&mdash;that she had
married against her grandmother's will and
that her husband had been an Italian. The
first batch of her grandmother's letters comprised
those which had been addressed to her
at school. They spoke of her holidays; how
glad the writer would be to have her granddaughter
with her again. These were full of
wise if rather trite counsels. The next batch
were those addressed to her at London.
These were full of reproaches and threats.
There were only five of these letters, and
some of them were smudged as with tears.
Luigi's letters were addressed to her at school,
to Miss Geraldine Dormer, Gore House
Academy. They were full of violent protestations
of endless love. Some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
began, <i>Carissima mia</i>; others, <i>Bella figlia
mia</i>. One of them contained this passage:
"The south is yellow with sunlight, but
more splendid is the yellow of your hair.
The dark skies of my native land tremble
with gems; but more beautiful is the gloom
of your eye, which gleams with the light of
your soul!" They were mostly written in
this strain, diversified here and there with
practical questions to which answers were
humbly supplicated.</p>

<p>I learnt nothing from them. I returned
them to the desk and went to look at
Geraldine. She lay perfectly still. I resumed
my seat and fell into thought. I wondered
whether it was the loss of her husband that
had made her crazy. Her marriage with him
had been a love match; that was plain from
the grandmother's reproaches. Passion, I
thought, might easily work disastrous changes
in such a nature as hers. But she had told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
me her husband had ill-treated her; and her
secluded life, her consistent language on this
subject, confirmed the truth of her assurance.
In my reverie I stretched forth my hand to
toy with a ring that hung from the desk.
Accidentally jerking it, a drawer started out.
I bent forward, and I saw that this drawer contained
a flat long MS. volume, together with
a couple of rings, a Catholic medal, and a
silver crucifix.</p>

<p>I extracted the manuscript and opened it.
On the first page was inscribed the word
"Diary." The opening entry was dated
185-.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>The Diary opened thus:</p>

<p>"Here am I in London. I don't know
whether to be frightened or glad. Luigi is
very kind, but he did not tell me he would
bring me to such miserable lodgings as this.
Would it not have been better had we never
met? I should have known that a teacher
cannot be rich. Yet I <i>do</i> think him handsome,
and he makes love so meltingly that I
would rather live in a garret than not have
married him. No letter from grandmamma.
She is very unkind. Mamma would not
have treated me so had she been alive. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
what is an orphan to expect but unkindness?"</p>

<p>A few days later: "To-day I heard from
Miss Cowley" (this was the schoolmistress,
as I knew from reference in the grandmother's
letters). "She says I have acted wickedly and
have forfeited all happiness in this world by
marrying a beggarly Italian teacher. How
my eyes flashed when I read '<i>beggarly Italian
teacher</i>!' The cold-hearted thing would
have cried with fear had she seen me. Luigi
is out all day and he comes in tired, and to-night
I thought he received my kiss coldly.
But it must be my fancy. Oh, what a fancy
I have! I think I shall go mad some of
these days."</p>

<p>The chronicle continued much in this
strain through many entries. It recorded
from time to time a letter from her grandmother
inclosing five pounds, but repeating
her assurance that she would have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
more to do with her. Then the tone of the
diarist grew more querulous; though her
love for her husband deepened, so it seemed,
in proportion as his fell off.</p>

<p>"How can I help being jealous?" she
wrote in one entry; "he is all day long away
from me teaching other girls, any one of
whom he may admire far above me and
secretly love. When I told him this he
seemed to shrink away from my look; and
indeed it was passionate enough; and he
cried out, half in Italian and half in English,
'God of mine! you will go mad if you do
not keep that devil of a spirit of yours
down!' I threw myself on his neck, and
asked him never, never to cease to love me.
His beautiful eye melted, and he fondled me
with his exquisite grace. So I go to bed
happy."</p>

<p>If her husband earned money she seemed
to benefit little from it; for some of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
records ran, that she had to sit in the dark
till he came home, for there was no candle
in the house, she had no money to buy one,
and the stingy landlady did not offer to lend
her a lamp. "To-day I dined on bread-and-cheese
and some of the potatoes left from
yesterday, fried. If grandmamma knew this
she would send me some money. But I'll
not write to her about it. No, she shall
think I am flourishing; and if I were dying
with hunger I would just wish her to think I
had plenty to eat."</p>

<p>Up to a certain entry she continued writing
of her husband in warm terms. She avowed
her belief that she must be somewhat crazy
to find him so fascinating. "Sometimes I
think him more so than at other times," she
wrote; but added, "if I am to regain my
reason at the sacrifice of my love I would
rather be mad." There was a good deal of
pungent writing in these entries. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
find nothing to illustrate the slightest mental
derangement. But her language was curiously
characteristic, and the exhibition of a nature
made up of warm and sudden passions, impulsive
and generous, but vengeful and
arbitrary too, was absolutely complete.</p>

<p>Before long her entries grew somewhat
incoherent. She is racked with jealousy.
She is certain that her husband has ceased to
love her. "I have been married now six
months," she says; "how dare I humour such
misgivings? But what is it that tells me of
Luigi's indifference? Not my bodily eyes,
for his behaviour is not altered. The spirit
sees farther than the reason. If I loved him
with my <i>mind</i> I should not have these presentiments;
but I love him with my <i>soul</i>. It
is my soul that is jealous; and the soul is
endowed with the vision of immortality and
can make the future present.</p>

<p>"To-day is my birthday. I am twenty-two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>years old. It has rained steadily since
the morning. I watched the muddy water
in the gutter boiling round the grating near
the lamp-post until I fell asleep. A cheerful
birthday! There was a little piece of boiled
beef for dinner, hard as my shoe, and the
potatoes were not cooked. Yet when Luigi
comes home, he never asks me if I am
hungry. Does he care? He would if he
knew. But how should he know? I
I am always pale, so that he sees
nothing unusual in my white face. I sometimes
think he is afraid of me. He said
last night, 'Your eyes flash like a madwoman's.'
I answered, 'It is with love!'"</p>

<p>There were no records of any hours of
pleasure. Sometimes she chronicled a short
walk. The place of her abode was not
named; but I judged from some references to
the locality that they must have lodged in the
neighbourhood of Leicester Square. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
landlady was a German, and the diarist complained
of the atmosphere of the house having
been made all day long nauseating and tepid
with the smell of cooking.</p>

<p>"I asked Luigi before he left for Hammersmith
to take me away from this dirty house.
But he shrugged his shoulders and said he
was too poor to move. I told him that the bad
smell of the cooking made me sick, and that
the landlady entertained foreigners, who came
tramping in at all hours of the day, jabbering
and singing like savages, and poisoning the
place with the rank fumes of tobacco. 'You
should write to your grandmother to send
you some money,' said he, 'and then we will
seek better apartments.' I told him I would
not write to grandmamma again after her
last letter, no, not if I were dying. 'Then
I am too poor to help you,' he said, stroking
his moustache and humming a tune, with an
air of such cruel indifference that my eyes filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
with tears, though my breast heaved with a
passion I could not keep down. 'We have
been married a little more than six
months,' I said, 'and you are already tired of
me.' 'And you of me,' said he. 'It is
false!' I cried, in a rage; 'but I suppose you
want an excuse for your increasing indifference,
and would tell a lie rather than
not have one.' 'You did not bring me any
money,' he replied, 'and yet you are always
grumbling at our poverty. Don't I work
like a slave for what I get? 'Tis a pity you
are not more educated, for you might go out
as a governess, and together we could earn a
competence.' 'I did not marry to become a
governess,' I said, 'and if you love me as
you once professed, you could not name such
a scheme.' He made a gesture of impatience,
and uttered something in Italian. 'What do
you say?' I exclaimed. He gave a shrug and left
the room. And this is what my dream of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
has come to! O how could I moralise if I
were not the text! Patience? Yes, I could
be patient if I had something solid to hold.
But can I be patient holding sand, and
watching the grains slipping through my
fingers? Oh! my weariness of heart! and
my head aches so I can hardly see this
paper."</p>

<p>Here there was a leaf torn out. The next
entry was dated exactly a year after. The
records now became rhapsodical. Strange
dreams were chronicled, and conversations
which she had held in her sleep.</p>

<p>The first entry spoke of her delight with
Elmore cottage. What followed was full of
brief references to the past, especially to the
events of the year she had omitted to record.
Yet brief as they were I could gather the
story.</p>

<p>Her husband had deserted her, possibly on
the very date of the last entry I have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>transcribed.
By her allusions to her feelings, the
shock of his leaving her must have driven
her almost mad. "I would thrust him deep,
deep into the <i>hell</i> he has lighted in my
heart against him; but he comes before me
in the night when I am numbed by sleep and
am powerless to thrust him off. O what
a hate his face drives into me!"</p>

<p>"To-day I came across mamma's emerald
ring. It reminded me of that day of hunger
when I had to pledge it. I paid the odious
German her rent, and went across to the
little cook-shop at the corner and bought
some cold meat. Do I not remember how
delicious it tasted! How did I live through
those days? I do not know. I sometimes
look at my body and wonder how it could
have held together under the pressure of so
much utter, utter misery. It is bitter to
have trusted nobly and to be betrayed remorselessly.
It is bitter to feel hunger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
poverty and the cruelties of the cold and
selfish world. But when these bitternesses
are combined, must not the heart be made of
steel not to crack and burst?"</p>

<p>How long she remained in this state of
destitution I could not gather. But in one
entry she recorded her amazement on receiving
a letter from her grandmother's
solicitor, saying that the old lady had died
suddenly, intestate, and that, as the next of
kin, she inherited the property. In the
same memorandum she referred to the
number of names she went over before she
hit on one to assume. It was her evident
fear that her husband would claim her,
should he hear of her whereabouts, now
that she had come into property. Under
the pseudonym of Mrs. Fraser, and hidden
in the obscurity of Cliffegate, she believed
herself perfectly secure against detection.
This at least is my inference, from one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
two passages in the diary; it is probably
correct. Some entries before that which I
am about to transcribe, the following notice,
cut from a newspaper, was gummed:</p>

<p>"March 12, at Courtland Street, London,
Luigi Forli, aged 35, of gastric fever."</p>

<p>And beneath it she had written:</p>

<p>"Sent me by Mr. Fells in the letter that
enclosed my quarter's money."</p>

<p>Up to a certain point, from this sentence
her diary was singularly rhapsodical. Then
a more connected narrative began:</p>

<p>"Why did he send me that bouquet?
'Mr. Thorburn's compliments!' He does
not know what sort of a woman he sends
his compliments to. How I hate compliments!
That vile Italian could compliment.
Oh! <i>per Bacco!</i> his speech was flowery and
sugary as a wedding-cake. What came of
it? My eyes, my hair, my mouth, my
skin, soon surfeited him&mdash;though he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>ransacked
heaven and earth for comparisons.
If I chose a male friend he should be blunt
and sharp&mdash;with a hard tongue that could
utter words as ringing in their tones as
sovereigns. Such a one would not send me
flowers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorburn called to-day. He must
have courage, for he knows my aversion to
society. If I walk in my sleep let him
thank me; he dared not have come without
this excuse. I felt my blood tingling in my
forehead and fingers when I looked in and
saw that the <i>gentleman</i>, as he had announced
himself, was a stranger. But the time <i>rots</i>
so with me&mdash;oh! that excellent word just
hits the decay of the hours! they drip, drip
away, like sodden wood&mdash;I could not be
displeased at his intrusion. There is life in
a new face, and I am beginning to think
Lucy too ugly to keep; now that is because
she is the only person I see, and her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
comes looking in on me through my ugly
thoughts and takes their deformity. But he
is nice-looking. He is thoroughly English.
Oh what a charm there is in a true English
face! It is so manly, so genial, so sterling
and courageous!&mdash;the very opposite to those
yellow Italian visages with their red-black
eyes and lollipop smirks. I am not sure
that I couldn't like this man. He invites
confidence, somehow. And there is a big
and ponderous ghost called Solitude, that
drives me towards him. His eye meets
mine fearlessly. He thinks me beautiful.
If he were to see me in a passion, with my
hair loose and my eyes on fire, would he
shrink like my valiant little southerner?</p>

<p>"I rated Mr. Thorburn to-day for watching
me. I must like him, to have spoken
so smartly. If I could not help meeting a
man whom I disliked, I would serve him as
my husband served me, and would betray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
him with such sweetness as would make him
think me a witch. I have the power. I
think I must be mad at times. Such high
thoughts take me that my body will not
hold my spirit, and some day I shall see it
glide from me and vanish, with just such a
laugh as I give when I know I shall not be
heard, and when my mood is intoxicating.
Let me own here, all to myself, that Mr.
Thorburn pleases me. He reminds me of
the picture of papa in grandmamma's locket.
He must be greatly taken with me to presume
as he does. He is too much of a
gentleman to force himself upon me as he
does if his courtesy did not fall before my
beauty. If he should fall in love with me&mdash;let
him. Am I a celestial intelligence, that I
can control a man's heart, and bid it not
love, if I choose it should not love? His
dream gives him a claim. If I was asleep at
the time then must that vision have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
my soul which slipped from my body and
shone upon him from a cloud. It was possible,
and I would have told him this, but
his smile can be ironical; and his nature is
not yet right for the reception of my beliefs.
Why did he kiss the rose I flung
away? I can tell; but I will not write it
down.</p>

<p>"He was more tender than he was yesterday.
His love deepens, and gilds his smile
and fires his eye. When I touched his arm
it trembled. He makes me no more compliments.
He relishes my bluntness, but
would he relish it if he knew the sorrow
whence it sprang? Sorrow is a rich soil;
flowers grow in it sometimes; but more
often grow roots that prick, weeds that sting,
blossoms whose perfume is poison. Shall I
encourage him? If I do, I will not have
the heart to say him nay, for he has brought
a new light to my heart and a new hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
my life, and my gratitude should make me
generous.</p>

<p>"My husband came to me last night.
He stood at the foot of the bed. His face
was as pale as the dim moon that shone over
his shoulder through the window. I thought
he had come from the grave, his eyes were
so hollow and his hands and cheeks so dry.
I clapped my hands and cried, 'Now I thank
thee, Oh God! for he is dead, and his
shadow has passed from the world.' I
awoke. I could not believe it a dream, and
crept to the door to see if he stood outside,
and went to the window to see if his shadow
was on the flowers. All was bare and bleak
and white in the eye of that cruel moon, who
looks into my brain and chills it with her
frosty glare. Then to bed again I went,
and fell a dreaming of Mr. Thorburn. How
palpable are my dreams!"</p>

<p>The following entry was dated some days
later:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>"He is making me love him. He has an
influence over me, and I find myself listening
to his words and cherishing them. He
makes me calm. Shall I forego the blessed
peace he transfuses through my being? I
could love him: but memory will not let me
go to him, and like a wrinkled hag casts her
long lean arms about me and holds me from
him. My heart is empty&mdash;there is room for
love. My spirit hungers; shall I not satisfy
her cravings? I weary of this solitude.
The air about me is peopled with spiritual
beings; I toss my arms, but they will not
leave me. They make my loneliness horrible.
One in the night told me I should be
their queen if I would go with them. But
where would they take me? I prayed to the
Blessed Virgin for help; but they would not
go. Why should they haunt me? I do not
invoke them. But if I fix my eyes on any
part of the room a shape comes out, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
have to dash my hand to my head and leap
like a child to frighten it off."</p>

<p>From this point there was a blank. When
she resumed her diary she was at Elmore
Court:</p>

<p>"How happy I am! The days go by me
like a song. I am loved tenderly and truly;
and <i>my</i> love grows deeper and deeper, like
an onward-running river. But the pain in
my head increases, and now and then some
of my old horrors return. I stood watching
Arthur for an hour last night. He did not
stir. His face was calm and happy, and my
eyes took their fill of its peace. He does
not know I keep this record, and he shall
not know. O God! if he knew the past,
would not his love fall from him like a
garment? But my memory grows weak;
and it is well I preserve these jottings, for I
could not taste all the sweetness of the present
if I had not the past at hand to contrast
it with.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>"This afternoon I saw a hand that held a
knife in the air. I trembled and cowered.
It slowly faded and I went on raking.
When I met Mrs. Williams I told her what
I had seen. The way she looked at me
pained me. I saw she did not believe me,
though she pretended she did. I do not
wish her to think me a liar. I made her
promise not to tell Arthur. I would not
have him think me untruthful for all the
treasures the sea holds."</p>

<p>The character of many entries which followed
was akin to this. Some of them contained
passages which would appear absurd
and incredible in print. Then came this
record:</p>

<p>"The room swims and I feel sick&mdash;so
sick that I wish to die. Arthur went to
London this morning, and I cried more bitterly
than he will ever know. He cannot
guess what agony our separation causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
me. It must be a cruel necessity that takes
him away. After he was gone, the sunshine
drew me into the garden, and I went
beyond into the fields, for my flowers give
me no pleasure when he is absent. Before
long a man came towards me, and I saw it
was Luigi Forli. I thought he was a vision,
and I tried to waive him away; but he drew
near, and laid his hand on my arm, and
turned me into stone. The blood surged
up from my heart and made my ears echo
with thunder. He talked, but I did not
hear him. Then he warmed, and cried out
that though I was his wife, he would not
take me from Arthur. I said, 'You are
dead.' He answered, 'No. I announced
my death to get a living.' And he said I
must give him money; he would keep my
secret and go away. He named a large sum.
He told me he knew I could not give it to
him all at once. I might pay it in portions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
He would remain at Cliffegate until it was
paid. What was it to him how I should get
this money? I had married a rich man,
and must get the money under any pretext I
could invent. If I failed he would call on
Arthur. I turned and looked at him, and
he sprang a yard away from me."</p>

<p>A line of writing that followed this was
illegible; it broke off suddenly. The pen
seemed to have fallen from her hand, for
there was a smudge across the sheet. A
single entry followed:</p>

<p>"He told me I was mad. I said, 'God
be praised, for it gives me courage.' I bade
him have no fear. He watched me with
glittering eyes; his face was hard with
avarice and pale with misgiving. I put my
hand in my pocket and said, 'When you
receive this you should give me peace.' He
shrugged his shoulders, and said: 'I am
poor; and since you are my wife and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
money it is fair you should help me to live.'
I pointed to the moon, and whilst he raised
his eyes I stabbed him in the back. He gave
a leap in the air, and I jumped away, for I
thought he meant to spring on me. But he
suddenly fell on his breast with a cry. The
dew fell like blood. I turned him over and
saw he was dead. I took him by the arm
and pulled him under the hedge."</p>

<p>This ended the diary.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>I went to the bed-side to watch her.
Her arms lay upon the coverlet; her lips
were apart, and she breathed heavily. Her
cheeks were flushed, and lightly pressing my
hand to her forehead I found that it burned.
I marked now that she slumbered no longer
peacefully. At intervals her form twitched, her
fingers worked convulsively, and once her
breathing was so oppressive that she started,
still slumbering, from her pillow, fighting
for breath.</p>

<p>I could see that she was very ill&mdash;very
feverish; and if these twitchings continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
must soon awake. As I expected, she suddenly
opened her eyes and sat upright. She
looked wildly around the room, and then
stared at me, but without recognition.</p>

<p>"Give me some water," she said.</p>

<p>I filled a tumbler and she drank it eagerly,
sank back, and dropped into a restless sleep
again. But in a few minutes she once
more started up and asked for water,
adding:</p>

<p>"Give me air. The bed-clothes suffocate
me. I am burning."</p>

<p>The fever, indeed, was on her now, and
I knew that she must have taken it from her
exposure in the grounds. I hastily left the
room, ran upstairs, and knocked at Mrs.
Williams' door. She answered at once. I
told her that my wife was taken dangerously
ill, and desired her to come to her at once.
I then hastened back and found that Geraldine
had risen from her bed, had thrown the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
window wide open, and stood leaning half
out of it.</p>

<p>I took her by the arm, and whilst I entreated
her to return to bed endeavoured
gently to lead her away. She resisted me.
Fearful of the consequence of her exposure
to the air, I exerted more strength. She
struggled violently, and would not stir. At
times she turned her head and stared at me
with angry eyes, radiant with delirium, but
totally void of recognition. Mrs. Williams
had now joined me. She at once perceived
the danger my wife stood in; also that she
was delirious.</p>

<p>"She must be got to bed, Sir, and kept
there," she whispered. "I will help you to
carry her."</p>

<p>I indeed needed her help. Frail and delicate
as poor Geraldine was, the fever made
her powerful as a strong man. She cried
and moaned piteously amid her struggles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
when we had laid her down it took our
united strength to keep her from breaking
from us and rushing again to the window.</p>

<p>She grew exhausted at last and lay still,
muttering wildly and clutching at the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>"We must send for a doctor, Mrs. Williams,"
I said. "Is there one in Cliffegate?"</p>

<p>"There is only Mr. Jenkinson the apothecary,
Sir," she replied. "But I could rouse
up Hewett" (the lad who attended to the
phaeton), "and it wouldn't take him long
to fetch Dr. Sandwin from Cornpool."</p>

<p>"Do so; and tell him to drive over as fast
as he can."</p>

<p>Geraldine lay back with her eyes wide
open, staring at the ceiling. Her lips
muttered continuously, but the exhaustion
consequent upon her violent struggles
seemed to have left her too weak to articulate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>I left her side and paced the room in a
mood I must not attempt to define. What
was I to think of her diary? That it was
an insane chronicle from beginning to end?
or that it was true? If insane, how much
was she to be pitied! For all that she had
recorded as having witnessed, endured and
done, must have been more definite and torturing
than ever the reality could have
proved. If true ... I dared not think it
true. Yet though we may barricade reason
with illusion, truth will somehow force an
entry. A terror that what she had written
was the truth, that her final record embodied
no imaginary tragedy, weighed upon me like
lead. I tried to shake it from my mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams returned. Her presence
was grateful. It forced me, so to speak, to
break from my hateful thoughts and to abandon
for the time being speculation for
reality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>The two hours that followed passed slowly.
Mrs. Williams and I spoke across the bed in
whispers. Sometimes Geraldine would start
up and call for water; sometimes would
make violent efforts to leave the bed&mdash;efforts
which it took all my strength to resist. As
the time went on she grew worse. She
talked incessantly, a mad wild talk, fragmentary
as the mutterings of a dream&mdash;at
intervals raising her voice to a shriek then
lowering it to a breathless whisper. What
visions passed before those vacant eyes of
hers God only knows! But terrible they
must have been; terrible the scenes they
enacted; for she plunged wildly, as seeking
to disperse them, then wailed entreaties to
them to vanish, whilst her body shook with
strong tremors and the hand which I held
grew wet as though dipped in water.</p>

<p>The morning paled upon the window-blinds
and made the candle-flame sickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
The birds twittered and distant cocks sang to
one another their early defiance. Presently
I heard the sound of wheels; Mrs. Williams
left the room, and returned some minutes
after, ushering in Dr. Sandwin.</p>

<p>He was a short spare man, suave but resolute.
He found her calm, for she had worn
herself out with her ravings and convulsions.
He drew to the bedside, held her wrist, felt
her forehead.</p>

<p>"She is in a bad way, Sir," he said. "The
fever rages. I will write a prescription, and
perhaps you will allow one of your servants
to run with it to the chemist at Cliffegate."</p>

<p>Pen and ink were produced and the servant
despatched. He looked at Geraldine
curiously for some time and then came round
to me.</p>

<p>"There is an expression on the lady's
face, Sir, which must be habitual"&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p>"Her reason is impaired," I replied.</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"The fever that is on her, Sir, arises, I
should say, from a severe chill. I judge
that her constitution cannot be strong, and
she should have been restrained from exposing
herself to the cold."</p>

<p>"She has a habit of walking in her sleep.
Last night she left her bed, and traversed
the whole length of the grounds on her bare
feet and habited only in her nightgown. I
feared this result, yet I did not dare awaken
her, having been cautioned against doing so.
I could only hope that the same Providence
that guided her steps would preserve her
from any ill effects."</p>

<p>He drew to the bed and examined her
face carefully. She lay so still that she
looked like a corpse. Her eyes were half
closed, and the whites showing through the
lids gave her the ghastly aspect of death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>"You look care-worn and anxious, Sir,"
he said, turning to me; "your vigil has
been a long and trying one. Can I induce
you to lie down for a little time? Even an
hour's sleep would benefit you, and enable
you better to meet the demands which your
wife's illness may yet make on you."</p>

<p>"What is your opinion of her case?" I
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I can form no opinion as yet. I shall
be better able to do so when she awakens
from this stupor. Meanwhile Mrs. Williams"
(he evidently knew her) "and I can
keep watch."</p>

<p>"I really would try to get a little rest,
Sir," said Mrs. Williams. "You look to
need it very badly. It is well to keep up
your strength, Sir; and I will promise to
call you if it should be necessary."</p>

<p>There was wisdom in their advice; I did
indeed require sleep. It was not so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
my body as my mind that was exhausted.
I said I would lie down in the adjoining
room, and begged them to arouse me
should the slightest alteration appear in her
symptoms.</p>

<p>I was chilly. The mornings were cold
now, and want of sleep had robbed me of
my natural warmth. I rolled myself in a
rug, laid myself on the bed, and in a few
minutes fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened from a deep slumber by
some one pulling my arm. The sunshine
poured through the blindless windows and
filled the room with light. My eyes,
heavy with sleep, were dazzled by the
glare; afterwards I saw Mrs. Williams. I
jumped up at once.</p>

<p>The look of white horror on her face
gave me such a shock that I could hardly
speak. I heard a whispering going on outside
the door. My belief was that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Geraldine
was dead, and I pressed my hand to
my heart while I asked Mrs. Williams to
tell me what had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir," she began, "it is too awful!
I&mdash;I"&mdash;&mdash;she stopped.</p>

<p>"In the name of God tell me&mdash;what is
it?" I cried, leaping from the bed.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;I cannot speak it, Sir;
the gardener is below&mdash;&mdash;will you go to
him?"</p>

<p>"The gardener! Tell me of my wife;
is she dead?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir. But she is raving wildly. She
has told the whole story&mdash;how she killed
him"&mdash;&mdash;she shook with horror.</p>

<p>Something told me what I had to expect.
I calmed myself by a supernatural effort.</p>

<p>"Where is the gardener?"</p>

<p>"He is in the hall, Sir."</p>

<p>I left the room. I passed the two servants
who stood whispering with pale faces near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the door, and ran downstairs. Both
gardeners stood in the hall; and both were
white as ghosts.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "what have you to tell
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh zur!" said the man called Farley,
"I went into t'orchard this morning to git
soom apples for cook, and&mdash;and I zeed
zigns anigh th' hedge of soom 'un having
been there i' th' night. The leaves they
was all tossed, and&mdash;and the ground fresh
dug. Zo I went for my spade, thinkin'
summut amiss, an' begun to dig to zee
what they moight ha' bin oop to. And zur,
in diggin' I strook summat zoft, and clearin'
away th' mould, coomed across a hand&mdash;a
man's hand, zur!"</p>

<p>"A man's hand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, zur! I wur too frighted to dig
vurther, but throws down my spade, and
coom runnin' to th' house to tell yer, zur,
of what I'd zeen."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>"Come with me, both of you," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, zur!" they began.</p>

<p>"If it be a dead man, of what should
you be afraid?" I cried fiercely. "Come."</p>

<p>I led the way out, and they followed me.
I did not want them to conduct me to the
spot; I knew where it was&mdash;I knew where
she had led me last night. I entered the
orchard, the two men behind me. In a few
minutes I had reached the place.</p>

<p>The soil was broken. Around it the dry
leaves and grass lay in heaps, as though
scattered by a high wind. Amid the newly-dug
mould I saw the fingers of a human
hand.</p>

<p>"Take that spade and dig," I said.</p>

<p>One of the men took it up reluctantly
and began to clear away the mould. Bit by
bit, as he dug the moist earth out of the
grave, first the arm, and then the body of
a man completely dressed, appeared. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
gardener stooped, took the arm by the
sleeve, and raised the body.</p>

<p>In spite of the soil that obscured the face,
I knew it. <i>The dead man was Martelli!</i></p>

<p>I gazed upon this awful spectacle with
fascinated eyes; then my senses forsook me
and I fell to the earth.</p>

<p class="space-above">For three weeks I lay as one that is dead.
The raging fever that consumed me brought
me to the brink of the grave; I was snatched
from the jaws of death by a miracle.</p>

<p>When I awoke from my delirium I was
at Elmore Court. The first object my eyes
opened on was Mrs. Williams. With consciousness
returned memory. I inquired for
my wife. The entrance of the doctor saved
her from replying. He forbade me to
speak, on pain of a relapse. Nature, utterly
weakened by illness, succumbed to sleep.
My slumber was protracted through twenty-four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>hours; and when I awoke I was convalescent.</p>

<p>It was then I learnt that my wife was
dead. Her death had occurred three days
after I was taken ill.</p>

<p>Towards the end the delirium had left her.
Reason had regained its power, as though
the soul, animated by the approach of death
and the promise of liberty, had shaken off
the foul hand of madness. She had asked
for me; they told her I was ill. She would
not believe them; she declared that I had
left her. They assured her that I was in
the next room; but she remained incredulous.
A nurse had been summoned to watch her,
while Mrs. Williams tended me. On the
night of her death, the nurse having fallen
asleep, she crept from her bed, stole to my
room, and was found by Mrs. Williams on
her knees by my side, with her arm round
my neck, her cheek against mine, dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>It was remarked, that after consciousness
and reason had returned, she did not speak
of the crime she had committed, nor did
her conversation indicate the memory of it.
Whence it was concluded that she died not
knowing what, in her madness, she had
done.</p>

<p>When my health was restored, my evidence
was taken with respect to Martelli's
death. The inquiry was purely formal.
During my illness the police had vigilantly
investigated the affair, and from Geraldine's
diary and letters, coupled with the testimony
of Mrs. Williams and the inquiries they had
prosecuted into Martelli's career, had established
the necessary evidence. From those
inquiries I gathered the following particulars.</p>

<p>Martelli's real name was Forli. He had
been a teacher of Italian at Gore House
Academy, where he had met Geraldine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
whom he eventually induced to elope with
him. Her account in her diary of the life
she had led with him was in every respect
accurate. But you will remember she had
omitted the events of a year, and that year
was now accounted for. Forli had left her,
to live with some abandoned woman, who,
after a few months' intimacy, avenged Geraldine
by plundering him of his savings and
leaving him. It was supposed that he had
heard of his wife having inherited her grandmother's
property; but his hatred of her,
which he never scrupled to confess, coupled
with his conviction that had he followed her
she would not have hesitated to commence
proceedings for divorce, which would have
professionally ruined him, effectually served
to keep him from her.</p>

<p>I could comprehend his hate, knowing his
character, and guessing Geraldine's power of
exciting hate in those she hated. When she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
had found his love decay, when her nature
had turned sour under the corrupting sense
of his violated vows and her betrayed confidence,
I could guess the kind of light his
presence would fire her eyes with, the kind
of language with which she would lash him
into madness.</p>

<p>When he applied again for work he found
that his conduct had excited a prejudice, and
that the schools in which he had always
found a welcome reception closed their doors
against him. He resolved to change his
name, not knowing how far this prejudice
might extend; and the better to commence
his life afresh announced his death in the
newspapers. He found employment; but
his means were narrow, his occupation very
limited, when my advertisement met his eye.
When he was once with me, it may be supposed
he was not very eager to go. He had
recognised his wife on meeting her in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
fields, but had kept his secret well. When he
found that I was resolved to marry her he
must have resolved upon that scheme, of
threatening her with exposure unless she
purchased his silence, which cost him his
life.</p>

<p>I suspect he had hardly resolution enough
to prosecute his plan at first. He had hung
about Cliffegate, so it was ascertained, after
he had left Elmore Court, living upon the
money I had paid him.</p>

<p>Some years have elapsed since those days.
I still occupy the house in London which I
took after getting rid of Elmore Court, and
Mrs. Williams continues to be my housekeeper.
My old dream of senatorial or
literary honour has never recurred. Like
Imlac, I am now contented to be driven
along the stream of life without directing my
course to any particular port.</p>

<p>The dead belong to the past, and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
not ravish from the grave in which she lies
that great sorrow of mine which lies buried
with her. No record of my grief shall plead
for her; no memorial of my despair shall be
set down to moderate your judgment of her.
She is dead. Her beauty, her love, her
madness, are nothing now but a memory and
a pang.</p>
